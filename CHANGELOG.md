## [Master] - 2023-10-01
  
### Fixed

- MINOR The calculation of the velocity on rotating walls was calculated inadequately [#896](https://github.com/lethe-cfd/lethe/pull/896): The velocity of rotating boundary conditions (e.g. boundaries of the mesh) was calculated inadequately in the case where the normal vector of the wall was alligned with the rotation axis. The whole calculation procedure was slightly messed up and only worked for cylinders. This has been fixed and made general, paving the way for a full refactor of the calculation of the particle-wall contact force.

## [Master] - 2023-09-30
  
### Fixed

- MINOR Affine constraints used to bound the void fraction and used as boundary conditions within the heat transfer and the block Navier-stokes solver were corrected [#885](https://github.com/lethe-cfd/lethe/pull/895): There was an error in the application of the affine constraints used to clip the void fraction in the lethe-fluid-vans and lethe-fluid-particles solvers. This led to assertions being thrown in debug. This has been corrected by reiniting the constraints with the appropriate size. For the heat transfer and the block Navier-stokes, the issue was that the constraints were never reinited with the correct size, so they contained ghosted elements. This was caught by a new assert introduced in 2023-09 within deal.II master.

## [Master] - 2023-09-20
  
### Deprecated

- MINOR The calculation of the source term was enabled using a parameter called "enable". This parameter was used in some physics, not in others and was poorly implemented. We deprecate the usage of this parameter and always enable source term, considering the fact that the default value of the source term is zero anyway. This prevent the false perception that source terms could be enabled or disabled, while the behavior was inconsistent across physics.
