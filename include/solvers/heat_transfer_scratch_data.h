/**
 * @brief TracerScratchData class
 * stores the information required by the assembly procedure
 * for a Tracer advection-diffusion equation. Consequently, this class
 *calculates the tracer (values, gradients, laplacians) and the shape function
 * (values, gradients, laplacians) at all the gauss points for all degrees
 * of freedom and stores it into arrays. Additionnaly, the use can request
 * that this class gathers additional fields for physics which are coupled
 * to the Tracer equation, such as the velocity which is required. This class
 * serves as a seperation between the evaluation at the gauss point of the
 * variables of interest and their use in the assembly, which is carried out
 * by the assembler functions. For more information on this design, the reader
 * can consult deal.II step-9
 * "https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/step_9.html". In this latter
 * example, the scratch is a struct instead of a templated class because of the
 * simplicity of step-9.
 *
 * @tparam dim An integer that denotes the dimension of the space in which
 * the flow is solved
