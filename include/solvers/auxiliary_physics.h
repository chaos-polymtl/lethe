/**
 * Au auxiliary physics is defined as a physics that is solved on top of
 * a core physics, the latter being the Navier-Stokes
 * equations. Auxiliary physics are simpler physics around which the entire
 * simulation process does not need to be tailored. Examples of auxiliary
 * physics are temperature and concentration. Generally, the auxiliary physics
 * does not affect the core physics. For example, temperature is advected by the
 * fluid flow, but buoyancy effects are not taken into account.
 *
 * The auxiliary physics are managed by the multiphysics interface of Lethe.
 *
 * This base class is used to establish all of the routines that an auxiliary
 * physics must be able to provide to the Multiphysics interface. These elements
 * are then called at specific moments of a simulation.
 *
 * Auxiliary physics are templated by the dimension of the problem and the
 * vector type that is used to manage their data.
 *
 *
 * Current limitatitations:
 *
 * - Auxiliary physics are currently expected to be used in conjuction with a
 * flow solver which can provide a velocity field.
 * - Support for feedback from the auxiliary physics to the core physics is
 * there but presently not used anywhere
 * - Support for interaction between auxiliary physics is supported but has not
 * been tested
