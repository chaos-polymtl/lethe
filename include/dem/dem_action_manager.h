/**
 * @brief Manage the actions to be performed in the DEM solver and on the DEM
 * part of the coupling CFD-DEM solver.
 *
 * Any event that needs some following actions is handled by the action
 * manager. The event communicates to the action manager that it happened and
 * the action manager will change the trigger flags to the actions to be taken.
 * When this action is about to be performed, it checks with the action manager
 * if it should be triggered.
 * Many events can trigger the same actions, but when the action is about to
 * be performed, it only checks if it has to be performed, not what event have
 * happened.
 *
 * If you implement a new feature that needs resetting or contact search after
 * (or other actions), you should add a new "step" function to the action
 * manager that will set the trigger to the action to be performed.
 * If you implement new actions, you should add a new trigger flag and a new
 * check function to the action manager. Obviously, you should also have to
 * initialize the trigger in the constructor, and reset it in the reset
 * function called after a DEM iteration.
 * If the action depends on a enabling of a feature, you should add a new
 * function to set the enabled flag.
