/**
 * Manages removing repetitions and adding new contact pairs to the contact
 * containers when particles are exchanged between processors. If the contact
 * pair (in adjacent particles containers) does not exist in the output of the
 * new (current step) broad search, it is removed from the contact pair
 * (adjacent containers), since it means that the contact is being handled by
 * another processor. If the pair exists in the output of the new broad search,
 * it is removed from the output of the broad search, as the contact is already
 * being processed. This process is performed for many types of particle-object
 * pairs : local-local particle-particle pairs, local-ghost particle-particle
 * pairs and particle-wall pairs, particle-floating wall pairs and
 * particle-floating mesh contacts pairs. Note : contact_type is important for
 * local or ghost particle-particle contact only
 *
 * @param pairs_in_contact adjacent particle-object pairs from fine search at last time step
 * @param contact_candidates particle-object contact pairs from board search at current time step
 * @param contact_type label of contact type to apply proper manipulation of contact removal in containers
