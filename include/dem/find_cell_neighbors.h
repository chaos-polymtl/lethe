/**
 * @brief Generate a periodic neighbor cells list of the cell. With the
 * coinciding_vertex_groups and the vertex_to_coinciding_vertex_group, we can
 * get the coinciding vertices on a periodic boundary and with v_to_c we can
 * get the list of the periodic neighbor cells to the main cell.
 *
 * Here is an example to understand how the search works :
 * Cell 8 have vertices 0, 1, 2, 3 on the periodic boundary. First,
 * it checks in the coinciding_vertex_groups if the vertex 0 is a key in the
 * map, and if it is, it gets a label, let's say label is 10. In the
 * vertex_to_coinciding_vertex_group, it can finds the the coinciding vertices
 * with the label. Using the label 10, it gets the vertices 0 and 34, which
 * means that vertices 0 and 34 are periodic. We do not want the cells
 * attached to the vertex 0 since they are already found with the regular
 * find_cell_neighbor function, so it skips vertex 0, but gets the cells 21,
 * 22, 23, 24 attached to the vertex 34. The same checks are done for vertices
 * 1, 2 and 3 and all periodic cells are return as a vector.
 *
 * @param cell The cell that needs the periodic neighbor list
 * @param coinciding_vertex_groups A map of coinciding vertices labeled by an
 * arbitrary element from them
 * @param vertex_to_coinciding_vertex_group Map of a vertex to the label of a
 * group of coinciding vertices
 * @param v_to_c A vector of set with adjacent cells of all the vertices
 * @param periodic_neighbor_list A vector which is the list of periodic cell
 * neighbors
