/**
 * The general idea behind the algorithm:
 * It uses the granular temperature to determinate if particles in a cell are
 * mobile enough that the contact forces are worth computation. A cell having a
 * granular temperature under a value (default is 1e-4) will have an inactive
 * status which makes them rejected in the broad search step. This results in no
 * contact forces or velocity integration in future steps for those particles,
 * which make less computation cost for the simulation.
 *
 * Cells may be flagged as that called mobility status:
 * - mobile (everything is calculated as if feature is not enabled)
 * - active (particles with low motion next to mobile particles)
 * - inactive (particles are not in a neighborâ€™s candidate list of cells around)
 *
 * There are some edge cases that need some attention. In these cases, particles
 * in cells can't be deactivated:
 *
 * 1. The solid fraction of the cell is under a value (default = 40%): particles
 * in the cell may have other forces that can move them and it is supposed that
 * with this fraction, there is not enough particles around to hold them in
 * their position.
 *
 * 2. Cells having empty cell neighbors: it means that particles are next to a
 * floating wall/mesh and they may have a change of contact forces from it if
 * the wall disappears or is moving.
 *
 * 3. The cell has cell neighbors which is flagged as mobile from the 3 criteria
 * mentioned above (granular temperature, solid fractions or floating walls):
 * this is because motion is badly propagated to particles to the cell around
 * without this additional "layer" of mobile cells.
 *
 * 4. The cell has cell neighbors which is flagged as mobile from the previous
 * criterion (additional layer of mobile cells): this is again to allow the
 * propagation of motion, but only the particles in contact with particles
 * from the mobile cells are considered for the contact force calculation but
 * their position is not computed at the integration step. Those cells are
 * flagged as active cells. It works with the assignment and verification of the
 * mobility status at nodes to check the status of the neighboring cells.
