 * @brief Calculate the coefficients required for BDF integration of order n.

 * The algorithm is taken from : Hay, Alexander, et al. "hp-Adaptive time
 * integration based on the BDF for viscous flows." Journal of Computational
 * Physics 291 (2015): 151-176.
 *
 * @param order The order of the BDF method. The BDF method of order n requires n+1 arrays
 *
 * @param time_steps a vector containing all the time steps. The time steps should be in reverse order.
 * For example, if the method is a BDF2, it uses three values for the time : (t)
 * (t-dt_1) and (t-dt_2). Thus the time step vector should contain dt_1 and
 * dt_2.
