## Release of Lethe v1.0.1 - 2025-05-28
The Lethe v1.0.1 release introduces some key new features including:

- A new DEM rolling friction model
- Two new VOF redistanciation/sharpening algorithms based on geometric and algebraic redistantiation
- Improvement to the matrix-free algorithm enabling its coupling with heat transfer, and also non-Newtonian flows
- Minor bug fixes and improvement

The Lethe v1.0.1 release comes with a structured and stable syntax. All of the examples and test provided with lethe were re-ran with this v1.0.1 release to ensure that all of the results provided online are up to date. This version is production-ready and has been tested and validated extensively.

## [Master] - 2025-05-27

### Fixed

- MINOR The output of the mass conservation table in VOF was resulting in a seg fault in 3D. It was permanently fixed by adding the missing column name in 3D. [#1541](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1541)

## [Master] - 2025-05-26

### Changed

- MINOR The rolling friction used in the hopper example as been change from 0.09 to 0.1776 to be equivalent to the one used in the reference article. This change will slightly affect the results from the validation script. [#1539](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1539)

- MINOR The particle_particle_heat_transfer files are changed to calculate heat transfer for both particle-particle and particle-wall contacts with the same functions, as the calculation is very similar. [#1534](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1534)

## [Master] - 2025-05-21

### Fixed

- MINOR The rotor mesh rotation in the mortar method context was being done by rotating the triangulation. This PR changes this so that the mapping is rotated instead. [#1536](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1536)

## [Master] - 2025-05-20

### Fixed

- MINOR The functions used to define constraints in navier_stokes_base were calling reinit() without passing the locally_owned_dofs. This caused the constraints object to not have the updated locally owned DoFs in each process. This has now been fixed. [#1533](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1533)

### Changed 

- MAJOR The architecture of the code for particle-wall contacts was changed to reproduce the one for particle-particle contacts and remove code duplication. 
The particle_wall_contact_info has been changed to a struct instead of a class and normal_overlap, tangential_relative_velocity and normal_relative_velocity_value are calculated on the fly and not stored in contact_info anymore. [#1520](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1520)

## [Master] - 2025-05-09

### Added

- MAJOR Added the buoyancy term to the matrix free operators to be able to support two way coupling between the heat transfer solver and the matrix-free fluid solver. In the GMG preconditioner the temperature solution is also transfered to all the MG levels. [#1524](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1524)

### Added

- MINOR Mortar: the matrix-based solver is now able to read 'gmsh' files, and a function to compute the rotor radius and the number of subdivisions at the rotor-stator interface has been added. [#1526] (https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1526)

### Added

- MAJOR Added the buoyancy term to the matrix free operators to be able to support two way coupling between the heat transfer solver and the matrix-free fluid solver. In the GMG preconditioner the temperature solution is also transfered to all the MG levels. [#1524](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1524)

### Added

- MINOR Some of the functions related to the mortar coupling have been refactored, and new functionalities have been added. For instance, the matrix-based solver is able to read 'gmsh' files, and the matrix-free solver is able to read data from the mortar subsection. A new coupling operator has been added. [#] (https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/)

## [Master] - 2024-05-07

### Fixed

- MINOR The solution preceding the algebraic interface reinitialization time-step is now also regularized using the same process to ensure consistency in the time integration scheme. This is done by replacing the relevant previous solution with the reinitialized previous solution. A new application-test (`vof-algebraic-interface-reinitialization-advected-circle-bdf2-frequency-check`) has been added to test this implementation. Also, a new validity map has been added to the VOFSubequationInterface. This ensures that subequations are solved using the correct VOF solution and in the right order. Subequations dependency checks are also made before solving each subequation. [#1507](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1507)

## [Master] - 2025-04-30

### Added

- MAJOR Multiphysic DEM simulations can now be launched with solver type dem_mp to follow the evolution of the temperature of the particles. The temperature is also added in the properties printed by application tests for the solver type dem_mp. [#1514](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1514)

## [Master] - 2025-04-25

### Changed 

- MINOR The find_cell_neighbors is now templated with a boolean so that neighboring cell vectors can be reciprocal, which means that vector i and j will contain cell j and i, respectively. [#1512](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1512)

### Fixed

- MINOR The Jacobian of the non-Newtonian GLS assembler has an error in the advection term. This has been fixed. [#1513](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1513)

## [Master] - 2025-04-24

### Added

- MINOR This PR Adds the find_line_sphere_intersection in lethe_grid_tools for use in the case of ray-particle intersection for the profilometry hackathon project. This function simply evaluates all intersection points between a line and a sphere. [#1511](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1511)

### Added

- MAJOR Adds an experimental prototype that uses the DG method to solve the VOF equation. At the present stage, this prototype is compatible with surface tension, but does not support any of the redistanciation mechanism nor the smoothing of the initial condition. Furthermore, it does not yield satisfactory results when BDF2 is used as a time integration scheme. This feature is thus very experimental. [#1510](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1510) 

## [Master] - 2025-04-24

### Changed

- MAJOR The parameters of the function which calculates the contact force, torque and heat transfer rate between particles were changed. Parameters torque, force and heat_transfer_rate were replaced by a class object ParticleInteractionOutcomes where they are stored. A function to resize these containers is also implemented in the class. [#1504](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1504)

## [Master] - 2025-04-22

### Added 

- MINOR This PR completes the signed distance solver by filling the (almost) empty architecture of the SignedDistanceSolver implemented in [#1451](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1451). Its coupling in the VOF solver (geometric reinitialization method) is also completed. The implemented routines follow the one of the already existing vof_advection prototype. [#1497](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1497)

## [Master] - 2025-04-17

### Added

- MAJOR The template parameter PropertiesIndex was added to the insertion classes to initialize the temperature only in multiphysic DEM. The template parameter dim was added to InsertionInfo (Parameters Lagrangian) to initialize the temperature with a parsed function in the parameter file for plane and volume insertion, which were modified accordingly. [#1491](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1491) 

## [Master] - 2025-04-16

### Added

- MAJOR The mortar feature from [#1462](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1462) started to be integrated into the lethe-fluid application. Together with [#1481](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1481), a new mortar subsection is now available the parameters file. Rotor and stator meshes generated using dealii grids are merged into a unique triangulation; coupling at the interface is not yet considered. [#1490](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1490) 

## [Master] - 2025-04-14

### Changed

- MAJOR The "tangential overlap" terminology is a misused of language since an overlap means that two things are occupying the same physical space which is not the case this vector. For this reason, this terminology was replaced by "tangential displacement" every where in the code and in the documentation. [#1492](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1492)

## [Master] - 2025-04-13

### Fixed

- MINOR In the sharp immersed boundaries solver, added a condition that clears the combined_shape cache if a particle has moved. This fixes a bug that would lead to an incorrect level set function when particles would move accross subdomains. This only affected the visualization of the particles. [#1479](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1495)

- MINOR The Rayleigh-Benard convection example would sometimes not work correctly on some machines and instead generate a static solution. This has been fixed by adding an initial condition in which a linear temperature profile is imposed in the direction orthogonal to the gravity (along the x axis). This also increases the robustness of the example. [#1496](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1496)

## [Master] - 2025-04-10

### Added

- MINOR Added an example demonstrating the use of the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) with the incompressible solver, using quadrilateral and simplex meshes at varying resolutions. [#1461](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1461)

## [Master] - 2025-04-07

### Added

- MINOR The GMG preconditioner in the matrix-free VANS solver now uses the void fraction on every level instead of only the finest one. [#1458](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1458)

## [Master] - 2025-04-02

### Fixed

- MINOR In the sharp immersed boundaries solver, added a condition that checks if immersed solids have moved since the last time step before executing mesh refinement. [#1479](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1479)

## [Master] - 2025-04-01

### Added

- MAJOR Added library for mortar feature, including tests using the Poisson operator and the Stokes operator. [#1462](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1462)

## [Master] - 2025-03-31

### Added

- MAJOR Added a new feature in the DEM solver. The base weight of a cell is now defined by a parsing function in the parameter file. This allows for cells to have a personalized weight depending on the position of their barycenter in space and time. This feature will be useful when dealing with problems requiring few load balancing steps, like the granuheap example, where the tangential overlap is important and needs to be fully tracked. [#1446](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1446)

- MINOR After a restart, the first time step is now automatically a load-balancing step, except if the load-balancing method used in "none".

## [Master] - 2025-03-28

### Added

- MINOR Added a functionality that allows to print the deal.II and Lethe versions when running an application via a '-V' flag. Also, a parameter that allows to print content of the input file to output is added. [#1475](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1475)

### Fixed

- MINOR Phase fraction gradient projection is computed with the filtered phase fraction gradient. However, before the starting the VOF algebraic interface reinitialization process, the filter was not applied leading to wrong values of filtered phase fraction gradient and therefore curvature. This is now fixed. Also, in the calculate_momentum function of VOF postprocessing quantities, the FEValues of the fluid dynamics was initialized with the FE degree of the fluid dynamics physics instead of the VOF one leading to a vector size error when getting the function values. The quadrature formula has now been changed to the VOF one. [#1474](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1474)

## [Master] - 2025-03-26

### Changed

- MAJOR Refactor the VOF interface sharpening and reinitialization parameters and merge them in one subsection called interface regularization method. [#1467](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1467)

## [Master] - 2025-03-26

### Added

- MINOR Addition of the explicit template instantiations for the PropertiesIndex of multiphysic DEM simulations. They are added to all files where there were already DEMProperties template instantiations. [#1469](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1469)
## [Master] - 2025-03-25

### Added

- MINOR Changed the simulation control to ensure that for transient simulation the last time-step is always written to a vtu file. Used this opportunity to improve the results for the rising bubble since the contour we were using to compare to the reference solution was not always the last output. Finally, changed the rising bubble example to use the BDF2 time integration instead of BDF1 [#1471](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1471).

## [Master] - 2025-03-21

### Added

- MINOR Fix the simulation restart. When instantiating a SolutionTransfer object, the average_values flag can be set to true to average the contributions to the same DoF coming from different cells. This boolean must be set to true during a mesh adaptation, but not during a simulation restart. The average_values flag was therefore removed from the simulation restart. [#1466](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1466)

## [Master] - 2025-03-20

### Added

- MINOR Addition of the periodic boundary conditions for the Cahn-Hilliard, heat transfer and tracer physics solvers. Parameters for periodic boundary conditions for all auxiliary physics (including VOF) now follow the same syntax as for the fluid dynamics solvers. [#1456](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1456)

## [Master] - 2025-03-19

### Added

- MINOR Verify if non-Newtonian fluid parameters are used in the matrix-free solver. Since the MF solver does not support non-Newtonian fluids at the moment, an exception is now shown if this happens. [#1463](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1463)

## [Master] - 2025-03-13

### Fixed

- MAJOR This PR switches the CI from the deal.ii-focal to the deal.ii-jammy image. This image uses Mold, which meant that some small refactor was necessary to prevent some compilation issues. Furthermore, this image uses P4est 2.2, which means that the restart files for the tests that require restart files had to be regenerated. [#1464](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1464)

## [Master] - 2025-03-13

### Added

- MINOR This PR adds the (almost) empty architecture of the SignedDistanceSolver and its coupling in the VOF solver (geometric reinitialization method), following the structure of the already existing vof_advection prototype. The parameters associated to the geometric reinitialization method for the VOF solver are also added. [#1451](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1451)

## [Master] - 2025-03-11

### Added

- MINOR Remove muParser and custom parsed function class (reversal of [#1143](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1143), [#1153](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1153), [#1160](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1160)). [#1452](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1452)

## [Master] - 2025-03-06

### Added

- MAJOR A first version of the lethe-fluid-vans-matrix-free solver is added. This version supports all of the preconditioners of the regular matrix-free solver. However, it is limited right now to void fraction fields which are defined using analytical functions and not from particles. Furthermore, it does not support any particle-fluid coupling. [#1448](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1448)

## [Master] - 2025-03-03

### Added

- MINOR New functionalities for interface problems are added. The PR includes the computation of the volume enclosed by a given iso-level of a level-set field and the surface reconstruction of the interface described by the level 0. [#1429](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1429)

## [Master] - 2025-02-28

### Fixed

- MINOR Simulation with dynamic mesh adaptation and the matrix-free solver could sometimes crash during the mesh adaptation stage due to the SolutionTransfer. This has been fixed by enabling averaging of the SolutionTransfer to reconcile incoherence between multiple cells. [#1436](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1436)

- MINOR Simulation with dynamic mesh adaptation and time-averaging of the velocity field carried out using the lethe-fluid-matrix-free solver would crash with a thrown error. This was caused by the fact that solution transfer with deal.II vector requires ghosted vectors whereas solution transfer with Trilinos vectors requires locally_owned vectors. This has been fixed by adding a const expression to adapt the behaviour depending on the vector type. [#1436](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1436)

## [Master] - 2025-02-27

### Added

- MINOR Add two parameters to the unresolved CFD-DEM simulations using the QCM void fraction scheme, allowing to choose the quadrature rule and the number of quadrature points used in the void fraction calculation. This implementation includes the Gauss quadrature rule (default) with 2 quadrature points as default and Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule with 3 quadrature points as default. [#1432](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1432)

## [Master] - 2025-02-24

### Fixed and added

- MINOR Temperature and heat flux time averaged quantities were computed at every output iteration instead of at every time iteration. A mechanism was also added to reset the averaged quantities to zero after a restart if the initial averaging time exceeds the simulation time. [#1431](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1431)

## [Master] - 2025-02-24

### Fixed

- MINOR The function get_properties_name() did not contain the pair corresponding to "volumetric_contribution". As consequence, the CFD-DEM vtu files would not have this property and would have an empty property instead. This PR adds this modification to the changelog as the addition of the property was pushed straight to master. The hash or the commit that pushes it to master is: 3dd817096cd2f5056902ace464e1aef9358c4ef8. [#1430](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1430)

## [Master] - 2025-02-22

### Added

- MINOR In the tracer physics, a new feature is added that allows to take into account single species reaction of arbitrary reaction constant and order. This feature works in CG or DG, with or without immersed solids. [#1411](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1411)

## [Master] - 2025-02-20

### Added

- MINOR This PR adds the possibility to rotate the laser around one axis when using the gaussian_heat_flux_vof_interface model. [#1421](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1421)

## [Master] - 2025-02-19

### Fixed

- MINOR The vtu output for 2D DEM and CFD-DEM simulations were not able to display the velocity and the angular velocity correctly. This is because the data is always 3D in the simulations even for 2D simulations. This has been fixed by always writing velocity and angular velocity as 3D vectors even for 2D simulations.[#1427](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1427)

## [Master] - 2025-02-18

### Added

- MINOR A new prototype for the geometric redistanciation is added. It includes an advection solver and the geometric redistanciation itself.[#1418](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1418)

### Fixed

- MAJOR Since [#1417](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1417), the restart_moving_receptable test had a segfault at the end of the simulation in semi-reproducible ways. After using valgrind, it was found that the boost signal that was connecting the Insertion class and the triangulation was causing this segfault when the triangulation was destructed. This was because the Insertion class was destructed prior, but the boost signals were still connected. To solve this issue, the Insertion class now has a destructor that disconnect the boost signal before destructing the whole object. [#1425](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1425)

## [Master] - 2025-02-17

### Added

- MINOR The neighboring threshold of some application test for the lethe-particles executable were using a value of 20 when it should be in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 . Concerned were updated to a value of 1.3 .  [#1427](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1427)

### Added

- MINOR A new example showcasing heat transfer in a cooling fin.[#1426](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1426)

## [Master] - 2025-02-15

### Added

- MAJOR A new rolling resistance model called the elastic-plastic spring-dashpot model has been added to the DEM. This model will help when dealing with static DEM problem, like in the realization of a heap of particle.[#1417](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1417)

## [Master] - 2025-02-14

### Fixed

- MINOR When outputting vtu files from the algebraic reinitialization process, the PVDHandler was accumulating vtu files of previous reinitialization processes. This is now fixed by clearing the `times_and_names` vector of the PVDHandler object when setting the initial condition. [#1423](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1423)

## [Master] - 2025-02-13

### Fixed

- MINOR The rotating drum example was updated to include a comparison with experimental results. The parameters of the example had regressed with time and we now obtain the same (or highly similar) results we obtained with the original Lethe-DEM version with the current master version. The main issue we had was related to the fact that the front and the back walls of the cylinders were not rotating in the rotating cylinders examples.[#1413](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1422)

## [Master] - 2025-02-10

### Added

- MINOR To improve VOF interface definition through simulations, a new algebraic interface reinitialization process was added. To reinitialize the interface, a non-linear PDE is solved. Since all previous added subequations were linear, a new class for non-linear subequations was added, namely PhysicsNonlinearSubequationsSolver. This class inherits from PhysicsSolver and follows the same solving algorithm as other non-linear equations solved in Lethe. The algebraic reinitialization PDE is integrated to the VOFSubequationsInterface.[#1416](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1416)

## [Master] - 2025-02-09

### Fixed

- MINOR Updated the installation instructions under Linux to specify installation since it was not previously explained. Took the opportunity to correct the graphviz for multiphysics problem. [#1419](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1419)

## [Master] - 2025-01-24

### Added

- MINOR A new validation case is added. This new case used the full scale rotating drum example. All the validation cases can be launch using the contrib/validation/validate_lethe.sh script.[#1413](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1413)

## [Master] - 2025-01-23

### Fixed

- MINOR There was a missing include (<deal.II/grid/cell_data.h>) for two tests. The include has been added. It has only been added for deal.II master since deal.II 9.6 does not have this include. [#1412](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1412)

## [Master] - 2025-01-23

### Changed

- MINOR The clang-tidy CI now uses deal.II 9.6.0 instead of deal.II 9.5.1 [#1410](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1410)

## [Master] - 2025-01-23

### Changed

- MINOR Update the installation instructions under WSL and Linux to use the deal.II 9.6.0 version instead of the 9.5.1 [#1409](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1409)

## [Master] - 2025-01-20

### Changed

- MAJOR This change deprecates the "l2 smoothing factor" void fraction parameter and introduces the "l2 smoothing factor length". The previous parameters, named "l2 smoothing factor", meant the square of the desired smoothing length. The new parameter, named "l2 smoothing length", is the actual length of the smoothing region. This was done by adding an attribute to the void fraction class (l2_smoothing_factor) calculated as the parameter's square. This way, the meaning of the parameter are more understandable and more easily manipulated. [#1408](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1408)

### Fixed

- MAJOR The change in #1406 introduced a major bug that would prevent the velocity, diameter, angular velocity and other particle properties from being adequately displayed in paraview. This PR fixes this bug by adequately positioning the output data when building the patches. [#1407](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1407)

## [Master] - 2025-01-17

### Changed

- MAJOR The order of the particle properties used for DEM and CFD-DEM has been changed. The mass is now the third property (index 2) instead of being the last. This change, which is purely esthetic, allowed us to fix a leftover bug in the visualisation of DEM results where the array allocated for the particle properties in the VTU output was not the right size (it was one double too small). Surprisingly, this was not crashing, but it was wrong in any cases. Furthermore, we figured out that some of the restart CFD-DEM application tests (the particle sedimentation and the gas fluidized bed) had wrong restart files. This PR addresses all of those changes and refreshes the restart files due to the change in the order of the particle properties. [#1406](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1406)

## [Master] - 2025-01-10

### Changed

- MAJOR The index of properties in the DEM and CFD-DEM simulations are now indexed using a template (PropertiesIndex) instead of using an hardcoded enum. This enables the different solvers to have different number of properties and different properties index. For large simulations, this gives minor performance gain for DEM simulations (e.g. around 5-10%), but this makes the solver significantly more flexible. This is a major change since it breaks DEM and CFD-DEM restart files from previous versions. [#1399](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1399)

## [Master] - 2025-01-02

### Changed

- MINOR All lethe-particles tests that have a restart file now start with "restart_". This nomenclature change is made to ensure that restart tests are easier to identify. Furthermore, all restart file generators have been tested and missing generators have beem added. [#1402](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1402)

## [Master] - 2025-01-01

### Changed

- MINOR All lethe-fluid-particles tests that have a restart file now start with "restart_". This nomenclature change is made to ensure that restart tests are easier to identify. Furthermore, all application_tests files now are seperated by underscores instead of a blend of hyphens and underscores. [#1400](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1400)

## [Master] - 2024-12-17

### Added

- MAJOR A new mechanism is added that allows to launch a series of examples specified in contrib/validation/validation_cases.txt using the contrib/validation/validate_lethe.sh script. This script automatically launches the simulations that are specified in the validation cases and keeps the logs, the simulation results used to generate the plots, the plots and generates a pdf report with all of the main results of the validation cases. This will be used to monitor the stability of Lethe on more complicated test cases than those that are tested within the application_tests. [#1396](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1396)

## [Master] - 2024-12-16

### Added

- MINOR A new post-processing code is now available for the rotating drum example. This code output the average velocity profile of particles perpendicular to the free surface. [#1394](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1394)

- MINOR Time averaged temperature can now be attached to the vtus using a new parameter in the post-processing subsection. A new object AverageScalar has been created. It can be used to calculate the time average temperature from a certain point in time. [#1395](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1395)

## [Master] - 2024-12-03

### Removed

- MAJOR The ability to bound the void fraction from below and above (using l2 lower bound and l2 upper bound parameters) has been removed. This bounding of the void fraction was highly problematic, since it could create discontinuities in the time derivative of the void fraction and contaminate the solution. In reality, this feature was never used. Importantly, this PR refactors the calculation of the void fraction outside of the VANS and CFD-DEM solvers of Lethe so that it exists only independently in a seperate subequation solver. This change is in preperation for the matrix free implementation of the VANS equations. [#1392](https://github.com/chaos-polymtl/lethe/pull/1392)
