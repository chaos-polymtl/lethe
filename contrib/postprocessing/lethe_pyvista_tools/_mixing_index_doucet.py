# Calculate mixing index using the method by Doucet et al. (2008)
def mixing_index_doucet(self, reference_time_step = 0, use_cyl = False, increasing_index = False, normalize = True):
    """
    Calculates mixing index per time-step using the method by
    Doucet et al. (2008).
    J. Doucet, F. Bertrand, J. Chaouki. "A measure of mixing from
    Lagrangian tracking and its application to granular and fluid flow
    systems." Chemical Engineering Research and Design 86.12 (2008):
    1313-1321.

    Parameters:

    :param reference_time_step = 0     -> Time-step used as reference to
    calculate mixing index.

    :param use_cyl = False             -> Choose whether to use cylindrical or
    cartesian coordinates. If use_cyl = True, .point_cyl will be used
    (check get_cylindrical_coords method). Otherwise, cartesian .points are
    used.

    :param increasing_index = False    -> Choose whether the mixing index is
    increasing or decreasing with mixing. Doucet et al. (2008) uses a
    decreasing mixing index, however, most mixing indices increase with
    mixing.

    :param normalize = False           -> Choose whether the mixing index is
    normalized according to the mixing index of the reference_time_step.

    This method assigns the following attributes to the object:

    self.mixing_index           -> Normalized Doucet mixing index per
    time-step. The normalization is done using the mixing index at
    reference_time_step.

    self.mixing_eigenvector     -> Eigenvector associated to the
    mixing index.
