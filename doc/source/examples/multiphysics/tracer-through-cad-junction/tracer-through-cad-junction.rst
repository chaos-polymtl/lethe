Tracer through CAD Junction in Simplex
======================================

In this example, we solve a problem using the simplex capabilities of Lethe. 
The simplex grids can be generated easily to represent complex geometries, such as a junction of channels made from boolean addition. 
We will also demonstrate the tracer physics capabilities.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

A junction of pipes following an arbitrary path is difficult to mesh properly with hexaedral elements. 
A simplex mesh, on the other hand, is easy to setup and can be built with many well-established algorithms; 
all software that can create a mesh can create a simplex mesh.
In this example, we consider a junction of pipes that follow orthogonal sinusoids.
This case shows how a passive tracer injected in such a geometry can be used to visualize preferential paths.


Generating a Geometry with SALOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complex geometries can be set up and meshed with the SALOME platform. 

First, the geometry module must be loaded as such, and geometric shapes can be added. For example, here, disks are drawn alongside sinusoidal curves that will be used for pipe generation through extrusion. The ``Fuse`` command can then be used to obtain a single geometry.

Second, the mesh module can be loaded to generate a ``.mesh`` file. A new mesh must be created with an associated geometry, algorithm and hypothesis. ``NETGEN 1D-2D-3D`` works well, and automatic hypothesis selection can be used. The element size can be edited to specific requirements, and then the Compute command must be used to generate the grid. Through ``File -> Export -> GMF File``, the ``.mesh`` file can be output.

Adding the Boundary IDs from Gmsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A criterion for the use of ``.msh`` file in Lethe is that the boundaries have an associated ID number. These numbers can be added in Gmsh.

The boundaries from the mesh must be linked to a Physical object. In 3D for example, the inlet, outlet and walls must be specified as ``Physical surfaces``. Selecting the surface for the inlet and outlet can be done easily, and then the ``.geo`` file can be text-edited to add a new physical surface with the remaining surfaces.

In this specific case, there are four boundaries: inlets with no tracer (1), inlet with tracer (2), walls (3) and outlets (4), as stated in the ``.geo`` file (see excerpt in the text block below).

.. code-block:: text

    Merge "Mesh-1.mesh";
    Physical Surface(1) = {729, 712};
    Physical Surface(2) = {10};
    Physical Surface(3) = {1:9,11:711,713:728,730:848,850,852:5000};
    Physical Surface(4) = {849, 851};

The ``Physical Volume`` must also be specified for compatibility with deal.II, as stated with this line from the ``.geo`` file:

.. code-block:: text

    Physical Volume(1) = {1};


The last step in Gmsh is to generate the 3D mesh, and then save it to a ``.msh`` file.


--------------
Parameter File
--------------

Using Lethe requires a solver executable, in this case ``gls_navier_stokes_3d``, and a ``.prm`` file. This second one can be setup in many ways, but for this specific case two aspects must be treated with more care: the enabling of simplex mode, and the setup of the tracer physics. 

Enabling the Simplex Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mesh
****

In the ``subsection mesh``, the simplex mode can be enabled with ``set simplex = true``. Also, the mesh in the ``.msh`` file must obviously be built with simplex elements.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type               = gmsh
      set file name          = vessels.msh
      set initial refinement = 0
      set simplex            = true
    end

.. warning::
    If the mesh type is set to ``dealii`` instead of ``gmsh``, the deal.II generated mesh will be properly built with simplices.

.. warning:: 
    [2022-01-19] It is crucial to consider a current limitation : simplex grid refinement isn't implemented in Lethe.

Setting up the Tracer Physics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the tracer physics requires four elements: activating the physics, setting the tracer diffusivity, setting the tracer elements order and setting the boundary conditions. These elements are provided as such:

Multiphysics
************

.. code-block:: text

    subsection multiphysics
      set tracer = true
    end

Physical Properties
*******************

.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      subsection fluid 0
        set kinematic viscosity = 1
        set tracer diffusivity  = 0.001
      end
    end

FEM
***

.. code-block:: text

    subsection FEM
      set velocity order = 1
      set pressure order = 1
      set tracer order   = 1
    end

Tracer Boundary Conditions
**************************

.. code-block:: text

    subsection boundary conditions tracer
      set number = 2
      subsection bc 0
        set id   = 1
        set type = dirichlet
        subsection dirichlet
          set Function expression = 0
        end
      end
      subsection bc 1
        set id   = 2
        set type = dirichlet
        subsection dirichlet
          set Function expression = 1
        end
      end
    end

The boundary conditions are written in a specific way. 
We have specified 2 boundaries, a Dirichlet condition with a concentration of 1 for the first inlet, and another Dirichlet condition with a tracer concentration of 0 for the second inlet. All the remaining boundaries are unspecified. 
An unspecified boundary condition in Lethe for the tracer is considered as the natural condition of finite elements, 
which is a zero gradient condition. 

.. note:: 
    The ``boundary conditions tracer`` subsection is different from the general ``boundary conditions`` 
    which concerns the flow. 

Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``boundary conditions`` subsection for the flow is setup as follows. The inlet with a high tracer concentration (``id = 2``)
is given a higher velocity than the other two (``id = 1``). The walls of the junction (``id = 3``) are given a ``no slip`` type.
The remaining boundaries (``id = 4``) are unspecified for the same reason as in the previous subsection: no constraint 
must be applied to the outlet flow. 

.. code-block:: text

    subsection boundary conditions
      set number = 3
      subsection bc 0
        set id   = 1
        set type = function
        subsection u
          set Function expression = 0
        end
        subsection v
          set Function expression = 0
        end
        subsection w
          set Function expression = 1
        end
      end
      # boundary id2 will have the tracer
      subsection bc 1
        set id   = 2
        set type = function
        subsection u
          set Function expression = 0
        end
        subsection v
          set Function expression = 0
        end
        subsection w
          set Function expression = 4
        end
      end
      subsection bc 2
        set id   = 3
        set type = noslip
      end
    end


----------------------
Running the Simulation
----------------------

The case must be run with the solver and the parameter file. 
The simulation is launched in the same folder as the ``.prm`` file,
using the ``gls_navier_stokes_3d`` solver. It takes a long time since problem is 
transient and the time steps are short:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    ../../exe/bin/gls_navier_stokes_3d tracer-through-cad-junction.prm


-------
Results
-------

The results in ``.pvd`` format can then be viewed using visualisation software such as Paraview.

The higher presence of tracer in the outlet on the same side as the tracer inlet may indicate poor mixing.
As the tracer diffusivity is low, the mixing between the streams comes mainly from advection.
However, since the kinematic viscosity is high, the flow is laminar (i.e. dominated by viscous forces) and
the streamlines do not cross.
