Description of the Case
-----------------------

Have you ever tried skipping stones on a pond or at the beach? If so, you have likely observed the mesmerizing ripples that form when the stone makes contact with the water's surface. Ripples and waves are an integral part of our everyday lives. You can witness their presence at the beach, where surfers ride them, when swimming in a swimming pool, or even when you drop a cube of sugar into your morning coffee. Notably, these phenomena occur at different length scales and propagate at a velocity (:math:`c`), often referred to as the *phase velocity*. Under the assumption that viscous stresses are negligible, the phase velocity of a single wave can be expressed as follows:

.. math::
  c = \frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{\omega\lambda}{2\pi}=\sqrt{\frac{(\rho_1-\rho_0)g\lambda}{\hat{\rho}2\pi} + \frac{2\pi\sigma}{\hat{\rho}\lambda}}

where :math:`\omega=\sqrt{\frac{\rho_1-\rho_0}{\hat{\rho}}gk+\frac{\sigma k^3}{\hat{\rho}}}` is the angular frequency of the wave with, :math:`\sigma`, the surface tension coefficient, :math:`k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}` is the wavenumber with, :math:`\lambda`, the wavelength, :math:`g` is the gravitational acceleration, and :math:`\hat{\rho} = \rho_0 + \rho_1` is the sum of the densities of the fluids `[2, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2015.01.021>`_ `3] <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.863522>`_.

The first term beneath the square root accounts for the gravitational contribution, while the second term is a result of surface tension. Depending on the wavelength, either of these contributions may dominate the other. When:

- :math:`\lambda \gg 2\pi l_\sigma`, gravity dominates surface tension and we get what we call a *gravity wave* (see :doc:`../sloshing-in-rectangular-tank/sloshing-in-rectangular-tank`).
- :math:`\lambda \ll 2\pi l_\sigma`, surface tension dominates gravity and we get a *capillary wave*.

:math:`l_\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}}` is the capillary length.

In this example, we simulate the damping of a small amplitude capillary wave in a rectangular domain of dimensions :math:`\lambda \times 3\lambda` with :math:`\lambda=10^{-4}`. The selected initial amplitude of the wave is :math:`a_0=0.01\lambda` giving us the following expression for the initial height of the wave:

.. math::
  y_0(x) = a_0 \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} x \right) = 1 \times 10^{-6} \cos\left(2\times 10^{-4}\pi x \right)

.. note::
  The origin of the plane :math:`\left( (x,y)=(0,0) \right)` is located at the center of the domain.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Neglecting the gravitational contribution, the phase velocity of the wave may be expressed as:

.. math::
  c_\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\sigma}{\hat{\rho}\lambda_\sigma}}

and the angular frequency simply becomes:

.. math::
 \omega_\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\hat{\rho}} \left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_\sigma}\right)^3}

Since, the phase fraction (:math:`\phi`) is treated explicitly, the temporal resolution of the capillary wave leads to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, also known as the *capillary time-step constraint*:

.. math::
  \Delta t_\sigma = \frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2} c_\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\rho}}{2\pi\sigma}{{\Delta x}^3}}

with the shortest unambiguously resolved capillary wave having a wavelength of :math:`\lambda_\sigma = 2 \Delta x` `[2] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2015.01.021>`_.

Therefore, in order to get stable simulation results, :math:`\Delta t < \Delta t_\sigma` should be respected. In this example, different time-steps will be used to explore the stability limit of Lethe's current implementation.

Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Below, the ``simulation control`` subsection for the case of :math:`\Delta t \approx 0.95\Delta t_\sigma \approx 0.95(3.9 \times 10^{-9})\, \text{s}` is shown. For other cases, the ``time step`` value will change and accordingly the ``output frequency`` will also.

The time integration is handled by a 2nd-order backward differentiation scheme (bdf2) with a constant time-step of :math:`\Delta t=3.7 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}`. To assess the stability of the simulation results, the wave is simulated for :math:`t_{\text{end}} = \frac{50}{\omega_\sigma} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s}`.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set method           = bdf2
      set time end         = 0.000045
      set time step        = .0000000037
      set output name      = capillary-wave-TSM-0_95
      set output frequency = 243
      set output path      = ./output-TSM-0_95/
    end

Multiphysics
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``multiphysics`` subsection is used to enable the VOF solver.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection multiphysics
      set VOF  = true
    end 

Initial Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``initial conditions``, we define the initial height of the wave, such that the interface (:math:`\phi = 0.5` isocurve) lies at the right height.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection initial conditions
      set type = nodal
      subsection uvwp
        set Function expression = 0; 0; 0
      end
      subsection VOF
        set Function expression = if (y<=1e-6*cos(2*3.14159/1e-4*x), min(0.5-(y-1e-6*cos(2*3.14159/1e-4*x))/1e-6,1), max(0.5-(y-1e-6*cos(2*3.14159/1e-4*x))/1e-6,0))
        subsection projection step
          set enable           = true
          set diffusion factor = 1
        end
      end
    end

Mesh
~~~~

In the ``mesh`` subsection, we define a subdivided hyper rectangle with appropriate dimensions. The mesh is initially refined :math:`4` times to ensure adequate definition of the interface.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type               = dealii
      set grid type          = subdivided_hyper_rectangle
      set grid arguments     = 4, 12 : -5e-5, -1.5e-4 : 5e-5, 1.5e-4 : true
      set initial refinement = 4
    end

Mesh Adaptation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``mesh adaptation`` subsection, we dynamically adapt the mesh using the ``phase`` as refinement ``variable``. We choose :math:`3` as the ``min refinement level`` and :math:``5`` as the ``max refinement level``. We set ``initial refinement steps = 4`` to adapt the mesh to the initial value of the VOF field.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh adaptation
      set type                     = kelly
      set variable                 = phase
      set fraction type            = fraction
      set max refinement level     = 5
      set min refinement level     = 3
      set frequency                = 1
      set fraction refinement      = 0.95
      set fraction coarsening      = 0.05
      set initial refinement steps = 4
    end

Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``physical properties`` subsection, we define the fluids such that both fluids have the same properties. We set the ``density`` to :math:`1` and the ``kinematic viscosity`` to :math:`5 \times 10^{-6}`. A ``fluid-fluid`` type of material interaction is also defined to specify the ``surface tension model``. In this case, it is set to ``constant`` with the ``surface tension coefficient`` set to :math:`0.01`.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      set number of fluids = 2
      subsection fluid 1
        set density             = 1
        set kinematic viscosity = 5e-6
      end
      subsection fluid 0
        set density             = 1
        set kinematic viscosity = 5e-6
      end
      set number of material interactions = 1
      subsection material interaction 0
        set type = fluid-fluid
        subsection fluid-fluid interaction
          set first fluid id              = 0
          set second fluid id             = 1
          set surface tension model       = constant
          set surface tension coefficient = 0.01
        end
      end
    end


-----------------------
Running the Simulation
-----------------------

We can call ``lethe-fluid`` for each time step value. For :math:`\Delta t \approx 0.95\Delta t_\sigma`, this can be done by invoking the following command:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 4 lethe-fluid capillary-wave-TSM-0_95.prm

to run the simulation using four CPU cores. Feel free to use more CPU cores.

.. warning:: 
    Make sure to compile Lethe in `Release` mode and run in parallel using mpirun.
    This simulation takes :math:`\sim \, 35` minutes for :math:`\Delta t\approx 0.95\Delta t_\sigma` and decreases to :math:`\sim \, 3` minutes for :math:`\Delta t\approx 20\Delta t_\sigma` on :math:`4` processes.

.. tip::
  In order to calculate the capillary time-step constraint and the simulation end time, a small Python script is provided, you may run it using:

  .. code-block:: text
    :class: copy-button

    python3 capillary-wave-calculation.py calculations.output

  with ``calculations.output`` being the file where the results will be saved. If you omit this argument, results will simply be displayed in the terminal window.

  .. attention::
    The number of refinements (``n_refinement``) that you enter on line :math:`67` of the script should correspond to the finest level of refinement of the mesh. In other words, it should correspond to the ``max refinement level`` of the ``mesh adaptation`` subsection of the parameter file.

    .. code-block::

        n_refinement = 5 # Make sure that this value corresponds to the finest refinement level of your simulation

.. tip::
  If you want to **generate and launch multiple cases** consecutively, a Bash script (``capillary-wave-time-step-sensitivity.sh``) is provided. Make sure that the file has executable permissions before calling it with:

  .. code-block:: text
    :class: copy-button

    ./capillary-wave-time-step-sensitivity.sh "{0.95,15,20}"

  where ``"{0.95,15,20}"`` is the sequence of time-step multipliers (:math:`\mathrm{TSM}`) of the different cases.

  .. attention::
    This script runs the ``capillary-wave-calculation.py`` script before generating the different cases.
    Make sure that the information entered in the Python script corresponds to the ones you wish to simulate.

Results
-------

We compare the relative amplitude :math:`\left(\frac{a}{a_0} \right)` of the wave at :math:`x=0` with the analytical solution (equation 22) proposed by Prosperetti `[3] <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.863522>`_.

The analytical solution csv file can be generated using:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  python3 capillary-wave-prosperetti-solution.py ./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv

with ``./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv`` being the path to the exported csv file (*don't forget to specify the file's extension* ``.csv``).

.. note::
  If you don’t have the ``mpmath`` module installed, you may install it using ``pip`` with the following command line:

  .. code-block:: text
    :class: copy-button

    pip install mpmath

.. attention::
  Depending on the case you wish to study, you may need to increase the ``degree`` of the inverse Laplace approximation using the Talbot method on line :math:`103`:

  .. code-block::

          a.append(mpm.invlaptalbot(A,t, degree=100)) # Depending on the solution, you might need to increase the degree

Results for :math:`\Delta t = 0.95\Delta t_\sigma`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After generating the analytical solution file, the results can be postprocessed using:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  python3 capillary-wave-postprocess.py . capillary-wave-TSM-0_95.prm ./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv

with ``./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv`` being the path to the analytical solution csv file.

.. important::
    You need to ensure that the ``lethe_pyvista_tools`` is working on your machine. Click `here <../../../tools/postprocessing/postprocessing.html>`_ for details.

A comparison figure for multiple time-steps can be generated using the ``capillary-wave-combined.py`` Python script:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  python3 capillary-wave-combined.py ./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv 0.95 15 20

with ``./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv`` being the path to the analytical solution csv file and the following arguments are the :math:`\mathrm{TSM}` you wish to add to your figure.

.. warning::
  Before running ``capillary-wave-combined.py``, data from individual cases must be extracted using ``capillary-wave-postprocess.py`` as shown in the subsection above.

.. tip::
  If you want to **prostprocess multiple cases consecutively and generate the comparison figure** in one entry, a Bash script (``capillary-wave-time-step-sensitivity-postprocess.sh``) is provided. Make sure that the file has executable permissions before calling it using:

  .. code-block:: text
      :class: copy-button

      ./capillary-wave-time-step-sensitivity-postprocess.sh ./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv "{0.95,15,20}" -sa

  with ``./capillaryWaveData_rho_1_nu_5e-6_prosperetti.csv`` being the path to the analytical solution csv file and ``"{0.95,15,20}"`` the sequence of :math:`\mathrm{TSM}` of the different cases to postprocess. The last argument, ``-sa``, stands for *solve analytical*, if this argument is added to the command, it will solve the analytical solution before postprocessing the results.

The following figure presents a comparison between the analytical results and the simulation results for :math:`\Delta t = \mathrm{TSM} \times \Delta t_\sigma` with :math:`\mathrm{TSM} \in \{0.95,15,20\}`.

A pretty good agreement is obtained for the :math:`2` first simulations, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the VOF solver. The unexpected stability of the solution at :math:`\Delta t \approx 15\Delta t_\sigma` is most probably the consequence of the implicit PSPG and SUPG stabilizations in the Navier-Stokes equations acting as artificial viscosity terms. These artificial viscosities locally increase the Ohnesorge number :math:`\left( \mathrm{Oh} = \frac{\mu_0+\mu_1}{\sqrt{2\hat{\rho}\sigma\Delta x}} \sim \frac{\text{viscous forces}}{\sqrt{\text{inertia} \times \text{surface tension}}}\right)` near the interface which can be correlated to the stability of the simulation. As :math:`\mathrm{Oh}` increases, it was found that the simulation results remain stable at higher multiples of the capillary time-step constraint `[1, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111128>`_ `2] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2015.01.021>`_.

By increasing the mesh resolution by an additional refinement, the :math:`\mathrm{Oh}` at the interface increases, therefore viscous effects increase and we get a more stable solution as seen below. However, we also see a slight negative phase shift.
