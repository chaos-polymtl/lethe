========================================================
3D Ribbon Mixer using a Single Rotating Reference Frame
========================================================

In the industry, when sizing a mixer, the power number (:math:`N_p`) a dimensionless number plays an important role. The :math:`N_p` relates the power consumed by the agitator to the geometry of the system and the characteristics of the flow in the tank. In this example, using a single rotating reference frame, we model a ribbon mixer for different flow conditions (different values of :math:`Re`).

- Solver: ``gls_navier_stokes_3d`` (with Q1-Q1)
- Steady-state problem
- Displays the use of a single rotating frame (srf) when modeling a complex rotating geometry
- Calculation of the power number (:math:`N_p`)

Description of the Case
-------------------------
We simulate the flow generated by a double helical ribbon impeller in a cylindrical mixing tank. The double helical ribbon impeller is an axial and a tangential impeller making it a great option for mixing viscous fluids.

The following figure represents the geometry of our system:

To be able to simulate the flow in such complex geometry, we take advantage of the symmetry of the system and opt for a Lagrangian reference. Instead of observing the velocity profile from an Eulerian reference (or lab reference), we place ourselves on the impeller's reference inducing a no-slip boundary condition on it. This way, the cylindrical vessel is going to be the only moving geometry in our system.

Except for the ``velocity source`` subsection, all other subsections in ``ribbon_gls.prm`` were discussed in previous examples.

Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

  subsection simulation control
    set method                  = steady
    set output name             = mixer
    set output frequency        = 1
    set output boundaries       = true
    set output path             = ./output/
  end


FEM
~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    subsection FEM
        set velocity order            = 1
        set pressure order            = 1
    end


Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      subsection fluid 0
        set kinematic viscosity            = 0.11602395351399172
       end
    end

Velocity Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    subsection velocity source
        set type         = srf
        set omega_z      = -10
    end

In the ``velocity source`` subsection, we specify that we are in a single rotating frame (``srf``). Since a centrifugal and a Coriolis force are induced by the rotating nature of the system, we are in a non-Galilean reference frame. These two additional force contributions must be taken into account in the Navier-Stokes equations and by setting the ``type`` parameter to ``srf`` we do so. The ``omega_z`` parameter represents the angular velocity of the reference frame.

        set calculation frequency = 1         # Frequency of the force calculation
