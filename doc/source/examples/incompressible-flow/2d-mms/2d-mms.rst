----------------------------
Files Used in This Example
----------------------------

All files mentioned below are located in the example's folder (``examples/incompressible-flow/2d-mms``). The files used for the quadrilateral mesh can be found in the ``mms_quad`` folder, while those for the triangular mesh are
grouped in the ``mms_simplex`` folder.

- Base case parameter file in each folder: ``mms_quad/mms_2d_steady.prm`` and ``mms_simplex/mms_2d_steady.prm``
- Python script to compute the source terms for the analytical solution used in this example: ``mms_source_term.py``
- Files to generate the parameter files at the different conditions: ``mms_quad/generate_cases.py`` and ``mms_simplex/generate_cases.py``
- Files to run the different simulations: ``mms_quad/launch_cases.py`` and ``mms_simplex/launch_cases.py``
- File to reorganize the output of the triangular mesh in a manner that is similar to the quadrilateral case: ``mms_simplex/organize_output.py``. After running the code, a directory ``mms_simplex/initial_output`` is created where the initial simulations output is stored
- Plotting the error for both mesh types is done through the file: ``plot_error.py``


-----------------------
Description of the Case
-----------------------

Each numerical model requires both verification and validation. While code verification ensures that the mathematical derivation of the numerical scheme is consistent and that the code implementation is free from programming errors, code validation is concerned with verifying the agreement of the mathematical model with the underlying physics. The MMS (see Roache (2002) [#Roache2002]_) is employed for code verification and involves evaluating the error defined as the difference between the exact analytical solution of the equations solved and the computed solution. 
Obviously, the exact analytical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is unknown. Therefore, the following procedure is adopted:

- The analytical solution is chosen such that all terms of the NS equations are non-trivial and non-singular. In other terms, the analytical function must be at least twice differentiable, with both its first and second derivatives being non-trivial. The analytical solution can vary in complexity.
- Once the analytical solution is defined, it is substituted into the steady incompressible NS equations, leading to the appearance of source terms. Hence, the defined solution is the exact solution of the original equations, with the source terms added. The modified equations, which now include the source terms, form a new set of equations to be solved numerically.
- The numerical code is then modified to incorporate the new set of equations with the source terms, and simulations are run at different mesh resolutions and for different degrees of the shape functions of variables. In this case, these correspond to the velocity and pressure shape functions.
- The computed solution is compared to the analytical one and the order of convergence is assessed.

In the current example, we choose the following analytical solution:

.. math::
  \mathbf{u} &= 2 \begin{bmatrix}
    (\sin(\pi x))^2 \sin(\pi y) \cos(\pi y)\\
    \sin(\pi x) \cos(\pi x) (\sin(\pi y))^2 
   \end{bmatrix}\\
  p^* &= \frac{p}{\rho}= \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)
 
where :math:`\rho` is the fluid density. The analytical solution is shown in the following figure:

.. image:: Images/analytical_solution.png
    :alt: The analytical solution: x-component of the velocity (upper-left), y-component of the velocity (upper-right), and pressure (bottom)
    :align: center
    :name: analytical_solution
    :width: 800

Since the velocity function is divergence free, no source term arises in the continuity equation. Introducting the previous expressions for the velocity and the pressure in the momentum equation leads to the following source term vector:

.. math::
  \mathbf{G} = \pi \begin{bmatrix} \sin(\pi y)(-16\pi\nu (\sin(\pi x))^2\cos(\pi y) + 4\pi \nu \cos(\pi y) + 4 (\sin(\pi x))^3\sin(\pi y)\cos(\pi x) + \cos(\pi x))\\ 
    \sin(\pi x)(16\pi\nu (\sin(\pi y))^2\cos(\pi x) - 4\pi \nu \cos(\pi x) + 4 \sin(\pi x)(\sin(\pi y))^3\cos(\pi y) + \cos(\pi y)) \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`\nu` is the kinematic viscosity.

Parameter File
--------------

The simulations are conducted on the domain :math:`\Omega = [-1,1] \times [-1,1]` using two types of meshes: one composed of quadrilateral cells and the other of triangular cells (simplex mesh). The degree of the velocity shape functions was varied from 1 to 3 for the quadrilateral mesh and from 1 to 2 for the triangular mesh, as deal.II does not yet support higher-order polynomials for simplex mesh elements. Additionally, for each velocity shape funtion, the degree of the pressure shape function ranged from 1 up to the degree of the velocity shape function. Finally, for each combination of velocity and pressure shape functions, six different mesh resolutions were tested on the quadrilateral mesh, while four resolutions were tested on the triangular mesh.

Since several parameter files are needed with a common syntax, except for the three parameters varied, a `parameter file template <https://chaos-polymtl.github.io/lethe/documentation/tools/automatic_launch/automatic_launch.html>`_ is used.
Consequently, parameter files are generated and launched automatically.

.. _Simulation_control_section:

Simulation control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this example the steady-state incompressible solver is used. 

.. code-block:: text

  subsection simulation control
    set method = steady
    set output name = output_mms_2d_steady_
    set number mesh adapt = 5 # Comment this line if using simplex
  end

The ``number mesh adapt`` is set to the number of refinements to be tested and is only compatible with quadrilateral meshes. In this case, the simulations will be run starting from the initial mesh until convergence is reached. The mesh is then refined once and the obtained solution is then used as an initial condition. This process is repeated 5 times. In this case, the output file will include the results corresponding to the different mesh resolutions. However, automatic mesh adaptation is not yet supported for simplex meshes, and separate parameter files must be generated for each mesh resolution.

.. _Mesh_section:

Mesh
~~~~~
The mesh used in this example is generated using the deal.II grid generator. 

.. code-block:: text

  subsection mesh
    set type               = dealii
    set grid type          = hyper_cube
    set grid arguments     = -1 : 1 : false
    set simplex = true  # if using simplex mesh 
    set initial refinement = 4 # if using quad mesh
    set initial refinement = {{LEVEL}} # if using simplex mesh 
  end

For a mesh with quadrilateral cells, the initial level of refinement is set to 4, which corresponds to 256 cells. For a simplex mesh, as mentioned in section :ref:`Simulation_control_section`, each refinement level is defined in a separate parameter file and  is repesented by the parameter variable {{LEVEL}} in Jinja2 format. The simplex mesh is selected by setting the ``set simplex`` parameter to `true`. In this case, a quadrilateral mesh is first generated at the specified resolution and then converted to a  simplex mesh using the `dealii::GridGenerator::convert_hypercube_to_simplex_mesh <https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/namespaceGridGenerator.html#ac7515d2b17c025dddc0e37286fb8d216>`_ function, which divides each square cell into 8 triangles.

Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The velocity components are set to zero on all of the boundary to match the analytical solution. However, the condition on each boundary can be changed depending on the analytical function used.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection boundary conditions
  set number = 1
    subsection bc 0
      set id = 0
      set type = noslip
    end
  end

Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this analysis, the Reynolds number (based on the maximum velocity in the domain) is taken to be 1, which results in the terms of the NS equation being of the same order. Hence, the kinematic viscosity is set to 1 in the ``physical properties`` subsection:

.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      subsection fluid 0
        set kinematic viscosity = 1
      end
    end


FEM Interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to the ``initial refinement`` parameter in the case of a simplex mesh, ``velocity order`` and ``pressure order``  are set to the {{Poly_deg_u}} and {{Poly_deg_p}} parameter variables, respectively, in Jinja2 format.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection FEM
    set velocity order = {{Poly_deg_u}}
    set pressure order = {{Poly_deg_p}}
  end

Non-linear Solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nonlinear solver's tolerance is set to :math:`10^{-10}` since the errors on the velocity and pressure fields reach values that are near or lower than the default tolerance of :math:`10^{-8}`, on the quadrilateral meshes with a finer resolution. Hence, if the default tolerance is used, the error will be constrained by this value and cannot drop below it.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection non-linear solver
      subsection fluid dynamics
        set tolerance = 1e-10
        set verbosity = verbose
      end
    end


Linear Solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only modification made in the linear solver section is the use of AMG preconditioning to accelerate the simulations. The default linear solver ``minimum residual`` is 100 times smaller than the non-linear solver ``tolerance``, and consequently, the former is not changed.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection linear solver
    subsection fluid dynamics
      # Set type of preconditioner for the iterative solver
      set preconditioner = amg
      set verbosity = verbose
    end
  end

-----------------------
Running the Simulations
-----------------------


The simulations are launched by first running the ``generate_cases.py``, then ``launch_cases.py`` scripts. The first script generates the folders and parameter files for the different configurations simulated,
while the second one launches the simulations.

As mentioned in section :ref:`Mesh_section`, for the quadrilateral mesh, for each combination of velocity and pressure shape functions, the mesh is refined automatically in a successive manner. Therefore, one folder for each combination of velocity and pressure shape functions containing the corresponding parameter file is created. Within each folder, the results corresponding to the different mesh resolutions are stored in a single ``L2Error.dat``. This is not the case for the simplex mesh, where a parameter file and an output file are created within a separate folder for each combination of velocity and pressure shape functions and mesh resolution.

Once the simulations are launched, the results can be post-processed using the python script ``plot_error.py``, which plots the error relative to the analytical solution at the different mesh resolutions and shape function degrees. However, before using this code, the script ``organize_output.py`` must be run to rearrange the results for a triangular mesh in a folder structure similar to that obtained for the mesh with quadrilateral cells. Hence, after running this script for the simplex mesh, folders are created for each combination of velocity and pressure shape functions, and within each folder, the error is rearranged in a single ``L2Error.dat`` file with the same structure as that for the quadrilateral mesh, thus containing the errors for the different mesh resolutions.

-----------------------
Results and Discussion
-----------------------
The following figures show the :math:`LÂ²` norm of the error relative to the analytical solution for the velocity and pressure fields as a function of the mesh size :math:`h`. The error is defined as follows:

.. math::
  |e_{\mathbf u}|_2 &= \sqrt{\int_\Omega [\Sigma_{i=1}^2(u_{i,sim}-u_{i,exact})^2]} = \sqrt{\Sigma_{k=1}^{n_{cells}}\Sigma_{j=1}^{n_q}\Sigma_{i=1}^2[(u_{i,sim,j}-u_{i,exact,j})^2]*w_j}\\
  |e_p|_2 &= \sqrt{\int_\Omega [(p_{sim}-p_{sim, av})-(p_{exact}-p_{exact, av})]^2} = \sqrt{\Sigma_{k=1}^{n_{cells}}\Sigma_{j=1}^{n_q} [(p_{sim,j}-p_{sim, av})-(p_{exact,j}-p_{exact, av})]^2*w_j}

where :math:`n_q` is the number of quadrature points in each cell, :math:`w_j` are the quadrature weights, :math:`n_{cells}` is the number of cells in the domain, :math:`u_{i,sim}` and :math:`u_{i,exact}` are the simulated and exact velocity components, respectively, and :math:`p_{sim}` and :math:`p_{exact}` are the simulated and exact pressure fields, respectively. The average values of the simulated and exact pressure fields are denoted by :math:`p_{sim, av}` and :math:`p_{exact, av}`, respectively, and are subtracted from the pressure fields to account for the fact that the pressure is recovered to within a constant. In fact, for incompressible flows, the pressure field constitutes a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the continuity condition through its gradient value. More details on the error calculation can be found by consulting the implementation of the function ``calculate_L2_error``, which can be found in ``lethe/source/solvers/postprocessing_cfd.cc``.

Finally, the mesh size :math:`h` is defined as follows:
  .. math::
    h_{quad} &= \frac{l_\Omega}{\sqrt{n_{cells}}}\\
    h_{simplex} &= \frac{l_\Omega}{\sqrt{(n_{cells}/8)}}*0.5

where the number of cells :math:`n_{cells}` is retrieved from the ``L2Error.dat`` files. For the simplex mesh case, :math:`n_{cells}` is divided by 8 to calculate the number of quadrilaterals used to generate the triangles (see section :ref:`Mesh_section`). Taking the square root of this number gives the number of quad sides on a given boundary segment and dividing the length of the boundary segment by the latter number leads to the lengt of the side of each quad. The size of each triangle is then half the length of the quad side. 

The following figure shows the variation of  :math:`|e_{\mathbf u}|_2` with :math:`h`

.. image:: Images/order_of_convergence_velocity.png
    :alt: :math:`|e_{\mathbf u}|_2`
    :align: center
    :name: Velocity_convergence
    :width: 600

The following figure shows the variation of  :math:`|e_p|_2` with :math:`h`

.. image:: Images/order_of_convergence_pressure.png
    :alt: :math:`|e_{p}|_2`
    :align: center
    :name: Pressure_convergence
    :width: 600

In both plots, the continuous lines correspond to the quadrilateral mesh, while the dashed lines represent the SIMPLEX mesh. It can be seen that the velocity converges to the order :math:`(p+1)` for a velocity shape function of degree p, except for the case :math:`\{Q_3-Q_1\}`.

As for the pressure, it converges at the second-order for the shape functions pairs :math:`\in \{Q_1-Q_1, Q_2-Q_1, Q_2-Q_2, Q_3-Q_1\}` and :math:`\in \{P_1-P_1, P_2-Q_1, P_2-P_2\}`, and to the third-order for combinations :math:`\in \{Q_3-Q_2, Q_3-Q_3\}`. It can also be seen that the error for the pressure increases with an increasing pressure shape function degree, except for :math:`\{Q_3-Q_1\}` and :math:`\{Q_3-Q_2\}` for the quad mesh.

Finally, for the same degree of the velocity and pressure shape functions and the same mesh resolution, the error is smaller for a quadrilateral mesh, for both the pressure and velocity fields.  

----------------------------
Possibilities for Extension
----------------------------

- **Use more complex analytical functions:**  Using a non-divergence free velocity field leads to the apperance of a source term in the mass conservation equation, as well as the contribution of all the components of the stress tensor in the momentum conservation equations. More complicated analytical solutions may be found in Blais and Bertrand (2015) [#Blais2015]_.

- **Unsteady equations:** Using the transient form of the equations with an analytical solution that also depends on time provides insight into the convergence in time.
