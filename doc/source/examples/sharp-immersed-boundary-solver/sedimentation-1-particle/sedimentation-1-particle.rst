Sedimentation of One Particle
==============================================================================

This example aims to numerically reproduce the results obtained by Ten Cate `et al.` `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1512918>`_ for the E4 experience. This experience measures the velocity of the sedimentation of a 1.5 cm particle in a container filled with a viscous fluid. The container is sufficiently small to impact the particle sedimentation.


.. warning:: 
    * This case is a computationally expensive example. It can take several hours to run.
    * This case is designed with the upcoming IB_contact_and_stability features.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

The E4 experiment consists in the release of a particle made of Nylon (:math:`\rho_p=0.001120 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{cm}^{3}}`)  with a diameter of 1.5cm. The center of the particle is located 12.75 cm above the bottom of a 10x16x10 cm container. The viscosity of the fluid is :math:`\mu_f=0.00058 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s cm}}` which is equivalent to :math:`\mu_f=0.058 \frac{\text{N s}}{\text{m}^{2}}`. The density of the fluid is :math:`\rho_f=0.000960 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{cm}^{3}}`. The gravity constant is :math:`g= -981 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{s}^{2}}`. The particle accelerates due to gravity until it hits the bottom of the container, at which point we stop the simulation.

.. note:: 
   You will note that we have transformed every length unit into centimeters. The reason is that the particle's size is very close to 1 cm. Representing the problem in this way helps the linear solver converge. It avoids extremely small values in the matrix due to the volume of cells being expressed in :math:`\text{cm}^{3}` instead of :math:`\text{m}^{3}`. 
    
All the container walls have no-slip boundary conditions except at the top of the container, where we define an open boundary.

Parameter File

We explain every part of this prm file in detail. In each section of the parameter file, we describe relevant parameters. The omitted parameters are only user preference parameters and do not impact the simulation results. For more detail on these parameter we suggest visiting the :doc:`../../../parameters/parameters`.
 
Simulation and IO Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set method             = bdf2
      set bdf startup method = multiple step bdf
      set time step          = 0.0025 # Time step
      set time end           = 1.3    # End time of simulation
      set output name        = out    # Prefix for VTU outputs
      set output frequency   = 1      # Frequency of simulation output
      set subdivision        = 1      # Mesh subdivision when outputend
    end


* The ``method`` is set to  ``bdf2`` to have a second-order time-stepping method. This ensures a low error due to the time discretization in this case.

* The ``bdf startup method`` is set to  ``multiple step bdf``  as we do not have an initial solution that allows us to generate previous time steps. The sharp interface immersed boundary is not compatible at this point with the sdirk solver. This leaves us with the multiple step bdf approach that will ramp the order of the scheme in the first few time steps.

* The ``time step`` is set to  0.0025. This ensures a low error due to the time discretization for this case.

* The ``time end`` is set to  1.3. This is slightly longer than the experimental results of Ten Cate `et al.` `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1512918>`_. This ensures that the entire trajectory of the particle has been simulated.

Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      subsection fluid 0
        set kinematic viscosity = 0.6041666666666
        set density             = 0.000960
      end
    end

* The ``kinematic viscosity`` is set to  0.6041666666666. This value is derived from the case description by dividing :math:`\mu_f` by :math:`\rho_f`.

.. note:: text
	The fluid density is not set here as the sharp interface solver has his own definition of the density of the fluid. This will be modified soon to unify both definitions in the parameter. 
	

FEM
~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection FEM
      set velocity order = 1
      set pressure order = 1
    end
	
Here we use Q1Q1 elements. This case is only for demonstration purposes as such we want to propose a simulation that is not too costly to run. 

Mesh
~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type               = dealii
      set grid type          = subdivided_hyper_rectangle
      set grid arguments     = 5,8,5: 0,0,0 : 10 , 16 ,10 : true
      set initial refinement = 1
    end

The domain is a rectangular box as such we can directly use a subdivided hyper rectangle mesh from the deal.II library. In this case, we have orientated the y-direction with gravity. As such, we have the long side of the box along this axis.

* The ``grid arguments`` is set to  ``5,8,5: 0,0,0 : 10 , 16 ,10 : true``. This section has 3 subsections. First ``5,8,5`` describes the initial subdivision of the box. This subdivision has been chosen as it is the smallest mesh we can do of the box in order to have cubic elements. Secondly ``0,0,0 : 10 , 16 ,10`` describes the 2 points from which we have derived the rectangular box (0,0,0) and  (10,16,10). Finally, we have ``true``, which is a boolean to activate the coloration of the boundary. This allows us to define separate boundary conditions at each side of the box.

* The ``initial refinement`` is set to 1. This will ensure to have a base mesh that is a bit smaller than the particle.


Mesh Adaptation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh adaptation
      # Fraction of coarsened elements
      set fraction coarsening = 0.3
    
      # Fraction of refined elements
      set fraction refinement = 0.05
    
      # How the fraction of refinement/coarsening are interepretedChoices are
      # <number|fraction>.
      set fraction type = number
    
      # Frequency of the mesh refinement
      set frequency = 1
    
      # Maximum number of elements
      set max number elements = 750000
    
      # Maximum refinement level
      set max refinement level = 6
      # minimum refinement level
      set min refinement level = 0
    
      # Type of mesh adaptationChoices are <none|uniform|kelly>.
      set type = kelly
    
      # Variable for kelly estimationChoices are <velocity|pressure>.
      set variable = velocity
    end

* The ``fraction coarsening`` is set to 0.3. This limits the accumulation of elements when the particle is moving. It allows for cells far from the particle to be coarsened when the particles get further away.

* The ``fraction refinement`` is set to 0.05. The objective here is to refine elements that become close to the particle when it's moving. This will mostly refine elements around the particle that are not included in the refinement zone around the particle. The refinement zone around the particle will be discussed in more detail in the IB particle section.

* The ``set frequency`` is set to 1. Since the particle is moving at each time step, the refinement zone around it should be reevaluated at each time step.

* The ``max refinement level`` is set to 6. This parameter limits how small the elements around the particle can get limiting the total number of elements in the problem. Here we limit the mesh size to 48 elements per diameter of the particle. This should be sufficient to get accurate results.

* The ``type`` is set to ``kelly``. Since the particle is moving and we do not want a uniform refinement of all the cells, we use the kelly error estimator based on the ``velocity`` variable.


Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection boundary conditions
      set number = 5
      subsection bc 0
        set id   = 0
        set type = noslip
      end
      subsection bc 1
        set id   = 1
        set type = noslip
      end
    
      subsection bc 2
        set id   = 2
        set type = noslip
      end
      subsection bc 3
        set id   = 4
        set type = noslip
      end
      subsection bc 4
        set id   = 5
        set type = noslip
      end
    end

Here we define the 5 ``no slip`` boundary for all the box walls and let the boundary with ``id=3`` free to represent the top of the box. We refer the reader to the :doc:`../../../parameters/cfd/boundary_conditions_cfd` section on how those boundaries are defined. 

.. note:: 
	The boundary id of dealii rectangular mesh are numbered as such:  :math:`x_{min}=0`, :math:`x_{max}=1`, :math:`y_{min}=2`, :math:`y_{max}=3`, :math:`z_{min}=4`, :math:`z_{max}=5`.


Initial Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection initial conditions
      # Type of initial conditionChoices are <L2projection|viscous|nodal>.
      set type = nodal
      subsection uvwp
        set Function expression = 0; 0; 0;0
      end
    end

The initial condition for this case is simple to define. At the start of the simulation, we assume that the particle and the fluid are at rest. From there, we define a uniform velocity field of 0 everywhere. To do that, we used the ``type = nodal`` and then specified a function expression of 0 for all the velocity components.  

Non-linear Solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    subsection non-linear solver
      set verbosity             = verbose
      set tolerance             = 1e-6
      set max iterations        = 10
      set residual precision    = 5
      set force rhs calculation = true
    end
	
* The ``tolerance`` is set to 1e-6. This is small enough to ensure that the flow field is adequately resolved, as here, we expect a velocity of the particle of the order of 10.

* The ``max iterations`` is set to 10. The objective here is to allow enough Newton non-linear steps to ensure the convergence to the tolerance. Also, we should limit the time pass on a single time step if the system is too stiff.  

* The ``force rhs calculation`` is set to ``true``. This is the most important modification with most of the other examples. By default, the non-linear solver will recalculate the RHS only after the update of the solution. But here, we need to evaluate it before every matrix resolution, and we cannot use the last RHS evaluation that was done after the last newton iteration. The particle position was updated between these two steps, changing the RHS evaluation. This means that for every non-linear step, we evaluate the RHS twice. The non-linear solver follows this sequence of steps for each newton iteration.
	* update the particle position
	* update the Jacobian matrix
	* update the RHS
	* solve the matrix system
	* reevaluate the RHS to check the convergence.
	
	
Linear Solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: text

    subsection linear solver
      set method                                = gmres
      set max iters                             = 1000
      set relative residual                     = 1e-4
      set minimum residual                      = 1e-11
      set ilu preconditioner fill               = 0
      set ilu preconditioner absolute tolerance = 1e-20
      set ilu preconditioner relative tolerance = 1.00
      set verbosity                             = verbose
      set max krylov vectors                    = 1000
    end

* The ``method`` is set to ``gmres``. This solver is less computationally expensive than the other option, and this case does not require any special preconditioner. This makes the ``gmres`` solver the best option available.

* The ``max iters`` is set to 1000. This is a lot more steps than how much it should take to solve the system.

* The ``max krylov vectors`` is set to 1000. This is to ensure that we keep the full Arnoldi basis for each new iteration. From experience keeping a maximum of Krylov vector results in a faster resolution for this case than clearing the basis after a certain number of ``gmres`` iterations.

* The ``relative residual`` is set to 1e-4. This is small enough, so we don't under-resolve our matrix and do extra non-linear steps because of it, and at the same, it doesn't require too many ``gmres`` iterations.

* The ``ilu preconditioner fill`` is set to 0. This means that we have a Jacobi preconditioner. This is the cheapest option. In this case, we are able to use this option without having to do too many ``gmres`` iterations. It requires less computational time to do a few more  ``gmres`` iterations than building the preconditioner and doing fewer ``gmres`` iterations.

IB Particles

    subsection particles
      set assemble Navier-Stokes inside particles = false
      set number of particles                     = 1
      subsection extrapolation function
        set length ratio  = 2
        set stencil order = 3
      end
      
      subsection local mesh refinement
        set initial refinement                = 6
        set refine mesh inside radius factor  = 0.8
        set refine mesh outside radius factor = 1.3
      end

      subsection DEM
        set particle nonlinear tolerance = 1e-5
        subsection gravity
          set Function expression = 0;-981;0
        end
      end
      
      subsection particle info 0
        set type             = sphere
        set shape arguments  = 0.75
        set integrate motion = true
        subsection position
          set Function expression = 5;12.75;5
        end
        subsection velocity
          set Function expression = 0;0;0
        end  
        
        subsection physical properties
          set density         = 0.001120
        end
      end
    end



In this subsection, we define most of the parameters that are related to the particle.


* The ``number of particles`` is set to one as we only want one particle.

* The ``stencil order`` is set to 3 as this is the highest order we can use for this case, and it will not lead to Runge instability.

* The ``refine mesh inside radius factor`` is set to 0.8. This creates a mesh refinement around the particle that avoids having hanging nodes in the calculation and helps ensure a small enough mesh around the particle.

* The ``refine mesh outside radius factor`` is set to 1.3. This creates a mesh refinement around the particle that avoids having hanging nodes in the calculation and helps ensure a small enough mesh around the particle.

* The ``initial refinement`` is set to 6. Here we want to have the mesh as small as possible for the first time step. To achieve this, we refine every element with at least one vertex in the refinement zone around the particle 6 times before the simulation starts. This ensures that all the cells in the refinement zone around the particle is as small as possible. This number of refinement is 1 more than necessary. This is to avoid having part of the particle not properly refined as the initial mesh is big enough that some elements cut by the IB may not be properly detected at the beginning of the process. Doing one more refinement ensures that all the elements are properly refined. 

* The ``integrate motion`` is set to true because we are interested in the dynamic of the particle as it sediments in the rectangular box.

* The ``assemble Navier-Stokes inside particles`` is set to false because we are not interested in the flow inside of the particle.

* The ``length ratio`` as been set to 2. This is small enough, so it does not impact too much the conditioning of the matrix while avoiding interpolation of the immersed boundary stencil in multiple elements.

* The ``particle nonlinear tolerance`` has been set to 1e-5. This is small enough to ensure that the particle dynamics are adequately resolved. We expect a velocity of the particle of the order of 10.

* The ``gravity`` ``Function expression`` is set to 0;-981;0 according to the definition of the case. As we choose the long axis of the rectangular box along the Y, we define gravity in this direction. 

The following parameters are defined in the particle subsection.

* The ``position`` Function expression is set to 5;12.75;5. This is the initial position of the particle according to the description of the case.

* The ``velocity`` Function expression is set to 0;0;0. This is the initial velocity of the particle since it starts at rest. 

* The ``radius`` is set to 0.75. This is according to the definition of the case where the particle has a diameter of 1.5 cm. 

* The ``density`` is set to 0.001120. This is according to the definition of the case.
