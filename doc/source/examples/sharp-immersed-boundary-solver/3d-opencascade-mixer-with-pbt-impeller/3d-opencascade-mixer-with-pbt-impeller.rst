3D Mixer with Pitched-Blade Turbine Impeller Using OpenCascade Sharp-Immersed Boundary
=======================================================================================

The mixing of stirred-tanks is a common chemical engineering problem that can be tackled through immersed boundary simulation. This example, a variation of :doc:`../3d-composite-mixer-with-pbt-impeller/3d-composite-mixer-with-pbt-impeller`, illustrates how the transient flow in a stirred-tank can be simulated by Lethe using the Sharp-Immersed Boundary formulation with a OpenCasacade shape from a step file.

* Parameter file: ``/examples/sharp-immersed-boundary-solver/3d-opencascade-mixer-with-pbt-impeller/mixer.prm``
* Step file: ``/examples/sharp-immersed-boundary-solver/3d-opencascade-mixer-with-pbt-impeller/impeller.step``

Description of the Case
-----------------------

In this example, we simulate a mixer using a PBT impeller through the usage of a step file with the OpenCascade shape feature of the sharp immersed boundary solver.


------------------------------------
Creation of the STEP File
------------------------------------

The step file can be defined using any CAD tool available to the user. The step file must represent a solid. It's favorable to avoid step file that represent shells, composite of solids or compound of objects.

.. tip::
	Use the union tool at your disposal to avoid issues with step files that are defined by a composite of solids. Most CAD software offers the possibility to define a solid from the union of multiple solids. Similarly, if the step file is only defined by a shell, it is usually possible to define a solid from that shell. If your CAD tool does not allow these operations, the FreeCAD software allows you to do these operations using the part toolbox.

Definition of the Shape and Its Motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The section defining the solid is almost the same as in :doc:`../3d-composite-mixer-with-pbt-impeller/3d-composite-mixer-with-pbt-impeller`, with the difference being the shape ``type`` and ``shape arguments``.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection particles
      ...
      subsection particle info 0
        ...
        set type            = opencascade
        set shape arguments = impeller.step
      end
    end

Additionnal information on the ``particles`` parameters can be found on :doc:`../../../parameters/sharp-immersed-boundary-solver/sharp-immersed-boundary-solver`.

Results

The velocity field obtained with this example is similar to the one obtained with the Nitsche immersed boundary and with the shape defined as a composite.

Using meter and second as the length and time unit and assuming a fluid density of :math:`1000 \left(\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}\right)` produce the following torque on impeller:
