3D Static Mixer Using RBF Sharp Immersed Boundary
=====================================================================================

The usage of `static mixers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_mixer>`_ is common for the blending of multi-component products in polymerization, as well as water treatment and chemical processing. They involve no moving part, but obtain mixing effects by converting the pressure gradient to radial mixing and flow division as the flow progresses through obstacles. Their advantages include low maintenance, no external energy input, continuous operation, compact design (pipe insertion), and easy installation.

As opposed to stirred tanks, it is not possible to modulate rotation speed or change the impeller. Hence, the design of these systems must be approached with precision due to these limitations. Factors such as the desired level of mixing and the properties of the fluids involved must be carefully considered.

----------------------------
Files Used in This Example
----------------------------
All files mentioned below are located in the example's folder (``/examples/sharp-immersed-boundary/3d-rbf-static-mixer/``).

**RBF preparation files:**

* Parameter file: ``rbf_generation/RBF.param``;
* Surface grid file: ``rbf_generation/helix.stl``. This surface grid was taken from `[1] <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3915237>`_ under CC BY 4.0.

**Lethe's fluid simulation files:**

* Composite geometry file: ``lethe_sharp_simulation/mixer_long.composite``;
* Parameter file: ``lethe_sharp_simulation/flow_in_long_mixer.prm``;
* RBF geometry file: ``lethe_sharp_simulation/RBF_helix.output``. The extension is ``.output`` because it was named from a `bitpit <https://github.com/optimad/bitpit>`_ perspective.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

In this example, we showcase the RBF type of objects used in Lethe's resolved immersed-boundary Navier-Stokes solver.


------------------------
Preparation of the Solid
------------------------

Generation of the RBF file from the STL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`bitpit <https://github.com/optimad/bitpit>`_ is an open-source modular library for scientific computing. The current section presents an example using its RBF capabilities to train RBF-networks that approximate the geometry from surface grid objects (`.stl`).

.. tip::
  In order to install bitpit, you need to have the github version of `PETSc <https://petsc.org/release/install/install_tutorial/>`_, which itself requires `BLAS/LAPACK <https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/node11.html>`_ and `LibXML2 <https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2>`_. In order, BLAS/LAPACK and LibXML2 must be installed, then PETSc, then bitpit.

  For the dependencies installation, you can use:


  .. code-block:: text
      :class: copy-button

      sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev libxml2-dev


  For the PETSc installation, you must first create a directory for the installation, then clone the project and configure it. Here are a few lines to help set it up:

  .. code-block:: text
      :class: copy-button

      cd /home/
      mkdir software
      cd software
      git clone -b release https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git petsc
      cd petsc
      git pull
      ./configure
      make all check


  For the bitpit installation, you must first create a directory for the installation, then clone the project and build it (ideally in a separate directory). The dependencies' paths must be specified. Here are a few lines to help compile bitpit with 6 processes:

  .. code-block:: text
      :class: copy-button

      cd /home/
      mkdir software
      cd software
      mkdir bitpit
      cd bitpit
      git clone https://github.com/optimad/bitpit
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ../bitpit/ -DBITPIT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DPETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc/installation/ -DPETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-debug
      make -j6


After compiling the library, we can use an executable ``/examples/RBF_example_00001``, along with a parameter file and the ``helix.stl`` in the ``rbf_generation`` directory.

The parameter file (``RBF.param``) contains:

.. code-block:: text

    nb_subdivision nb_adaptions radius_ratio base_function mesh_range
    16             4            3            1             0.1


#. The number of subdivisions in each of the three spatial dimensions: ``16``;
#. The number of adaption cycles. Using ``4`` adaptation cycles over a initial number of ``16`` subdivisions results in a level of detail equivalent to a number of ``256`` subdivisions;
#. The radius ratio means that each node `sees` up to ``3`` neighbors in each direction, which results in a smooth approximation.
#. The base function of ``1`` means that the basis function is of Wendland type. This is the best function to represent geometries from our experience.
#. The mesh range of ``0.1`` means that there is at least 10% of margin on each side of the object, so the collection of RBF nodes are encompassing the whole object.


Assuming that the ``RBF_example_00001`` executable is within your `$PATH` or copied to ``/rbf_generation/`` directory, we can launch the RBF generation from ``/rbf_generation/`` using the command line:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  RBF_example_00001 ./ helix RBF.param

After about 40 minutes this executable will output ``RBF_helix.output``, which is the encoding of the shape, and ``RBF_helix.vtu``, which can be used to see the resulting approximation.

Creation of the Composite Shape File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The complete geometry through which the fluid flows contains the helix static mixer as well as the casing around it. We use composite shapes to build the complex geometry; this type of shape is introduced in this example: :doc:`../simple-plane-model-from-composite/simple-plane-model-from-composite`. The main particularities of the current composite shape are:

#. The translation parameter for the ``rbf`` shape is ``-76.201:-20.0098:+15.6051``. It is selected to ensure that the center of the static mixer is located at the origin. The coordinates are taken from ``rbf_generation/bitpit.log``.
#. The ``hyper rectangle`` is long enough to cover the length of the helix, and just large enough to fit in the background grid.
#. The ``cylinder`` hole is set to have a very high length to ensure that the difference operation applies properly over the whole domain.
#. Operation ``15`` forms the casing, and operation ``16`` joins the casing and the helix. The final operation is the one considered as definitive.

---------------
Parameter File
---------------

Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although we are interested in the steady-state solution of the flow, we use ``bdf1`` time integration. The required time to reach steady state in our case is low, but solving it with a small value of the time step enables the non-linear solver to converge as complex flow patterns are difficult to capture otherwise.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set method      = bdf1
      set time end    = 40e-4
      set time step   = 1e-4
      set output path = ./output/
      set output name = output
    end

Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We assume that the fluid is water, and that the length of the static mixer is in the order of :math:`150 \, \text{cm}`. Hence,  the length units are centimeters and the time units are seconds. The ``kinematic viscosity`` of water is :math:`0.01 \, \text{cm²}/\text{s}`.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      subsection fluid 0
        set kinematic viscosity = 0.01
      end
    end


Mesh and Mesh Adaptation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mesh is a simple hyper rectangle, large enough to encompass the mixer with its casing and long enough to establish the flow profile upstream and downstream.


.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type      = dealii
      set grid type = subdivided_hyper_rectangle

      # Grid to use when solving the flow in the long version of the mixer
      set grid arguments = 6,1,1: -150,-25,-25: 150,25,25: true

      set initial refinement = 3
    end

Mesh adaptation ``type`` is set to ``kelly``, to allow adaptive refinement at the solid surface. This is necessary for simulations of this type because of the prohibitive mesh size required when only uniform refinement is used. Setting ``max refinement level = 5`` allows for two levels of adaptive refinement from the uniform ``initial refinement = 3`` defined in the ``mesh`` section. The ``frequency = 0`` ensures that no refinement occurs between time steps, as it is not necessary here. The ``initial refinement steps = 0`` to highlight that no initial refinement is requested here; the initial refinements are requested from ``subsection particles`` because they are base on the solid geometry.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh adaptation
      set type                     = kelly
      set fraction type            = number
      set max number elements      = 2000000
      set max refinement level     = 5
      set min refinement level     = 0
      set frequency                = 0
      set initial refinement steps = 0
    end



Definition of the Shape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines each parameter for the particles and has certain requirements:

.. code-block:: text

    subsection particles
      set assemble Navier-Stokes inside particles = false
      set number of particles                     = 1

      subsection extrapolation function
        set length ratio  = 4
        set stencil order = 1
      end

      subsection local mesh refinement
        set initial refinement                = 4
        set refine mesh inside radius factor  = 1
        set refine mesh outside radius factor = 1
        set refinement zone extrapolation     = false
      end

      subsection particle info 0
        set type            = composite
        set shape arguments = mixer_long.composite
      end
    end


#. In ``subsection extrapolation function``, ``length ratio`` defines the length used to apply the immersed boundaries through interpolation. We choose ``4`` as a compromise between a low value, which is better for the linear solver, and a high value, which is better for mass preservation. The latter can also be increased using a finer grid.
#. In ``subsection local mesh refinement``, ``refine mesh inside radius factor`` and ``refine mesh outside radius factor`` are both set to ``1``, which activates minimal crown refinement mode.
#. In ``subsection particle info 0``, ``type = composite`` and ``shape arguments = mixer_long.composite`` define the shape itself. This requires that the ``RBF_helix.output`` is located in the same directory as the parameter file.



Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A condition is assigned to each boundary:

#. The inlet is set to a Dirichlet boundary condition with unit velocity in the `x` direction.
#. The outlet is defined as such, and is the weakly imposed condition required when using ``lethe-fluid-sharp``.
#. The remaining boundaries are set as ``noslip`` to emulate the flow in a channel.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection boundary conditions
    set number = 6
    subsection bc 0
      set id   = 0
      set type = function
      subsection u
        set Function expression = 1
      end
    end
    subsection bc 1
      set id   = 1
      set type = outlet
    end
    subsection bc 2
      set id   = 2
      set type = noslip
    end
    subsection bc 3
      set id   = 3
      set type = noslip
    end
    subsection bc 4
      set id   = 4
      set type = noslip
    end
    subsection bc 5
      set id   = 5
      set type = noslip
    end
  end


Post-Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pressure drop and flow rate post-processing are enabled to track when steady state is reached and to ensure that mass is preserved. Too high variations between inlet and outlet flow rates are linked to increased error on the pressure drop predictions.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection post-processing
    set verbosity               = verbose
    set calculate pressure drop = true
    set calculate flow rate     = true
    set inlet boundary id       = 0
    set outlet boundary id      = 1
  end


-----------------------
Running the Simulation
-----------------------

The simulation can be launched on multiple cores using ``mpirun`` and the ``lethe-fluid-sharp`` executable. Using 6 CPU cores (for an approximate runtime of 50 minutes), the simulation can be launched with:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 6 lethe-fluid-sharp flow_in_long_mixer.prm



--------
Results
--------

After the simulation has run, streamlines can be used to visualize the pressure and velocity fields through the static mixer, as well as show the mixing effects that can be obtained.

The mass conservation and pressure drop can both be monitored by plotting their values in time, extracted from ``/output/flow_rate.dat`` and ``/output/pressure_drop.dat``. The Python script ``postprocess_flow_and_pressure.py`` generates the following plot:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

    python3 postprocess_flow_and_pressure.py


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  .. figure:: images/mass_and_pressure_drop.svg                                                                              |
|     :align: center                                                                                                          |
|     :width: 800                                                                                                             |
|     :name: Mass conservation and pressure drop                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

As the plot shows, the mass conservation is constant after only a few time steps; it depends mostly on the length ratio, residual and grid refinement. The pressure drop, on the other hand, decreases steadily. We stopped the simulation after 40 time steps because the decrease is then low enough, but increasing the total duration would be interesting to get a better idea of the steady-state pressure drop.
