Description of the Case
-----------------------

This example presents the creation of a simple plane model using a composite shape. This example does a step-by-step creation of the shape. This plane is not a real model. The parameter used only aims at showcasing the different operations of the composite shape creation. The final product will look as follows:

------------------------------------
Creation of the Composite Shape File
------------------------------------

The shape is created in two steps inspired by the GMSH syntax.

1. Basic shape definitions. Shapes are defined with different parameters: shape ID, shape type, arguments, position, and orientation.
2. Boolean operations definitions. Operations are defined by: operation ID, operation type, shape 1 ID, shape 2 ID. 

Shapes and boolean operations each have an ID, and boolean operations can reference previous operations to build upon them. The final shape obtained is the product of the operation with the largest ID. To facilitate shape creation, we start indexing the operations from ID 30. This index is much larger than the number of primitives used.
 
All the shapes are placed in the reference frame of the composite shape which can then be moved depending on the position and orientation of the shape prescribed in the parameter file of the case. Here, we only focus on the step-by-step operation required to generate this complex shape.


.. Note:: 
    This model uses multiple shapes that are referred to as superquadric ellipsoids. This superquadric shape has at least two axes defined using a 2-order power. Any slice of this type of superquadric, parallel to the plane defined by these two axes, is an ellipse. If the remaining axis has a higher power, then the shape will tend toward an extrusion of an ellipse with a rounded tip. 

The ``plane.composite`` file contains these instructions. The plane along the X-axis and the positive Z-axis is in the above direction of the plane. The Y-axis points in the left direction of the plane.

.. warning:: 
    The human interpretation of the composite files is cumbersome. For this reason we add comments to each line.

Let us read this file step-by-step line-by-line:


1. First, we create the left wing. This wing is created using a superquadric ellipsoid shape. Along the cord, we use an elongated ellipsoid with length 0.6 and 0.1 thickness. In the wingspan direction, the wing is defined by a 6-order power superquadric with a half wingspan of 2.5. We then tilt the wing backward by 0.25 rad and give a small angle of attack of 0.05 rad. Since the wing is now tilted backward, the right side of the superquadric shape is undesirable, so we remove it using a hypercube to trim the right side of the wing.

    operations
    30; difference  ; 1:0 # Trim off the left wing

This step gives us the first wing of the plane.

2. We repeat the same operation for the right wing and add a union of the left and right wing.

    31; difference  ; 3:2 # Trim off the right wing
    32; union       ; 30:31 # Combine the two wings

This step gives us the first wing of the plane.

3. Next, we add the fuselage of the plane. We approximate the fuselage with a circular superquadric shape with a length of 3 and a radius of 0.3. On the length of the plane, the superquadric is of power 3. We want the wings to be a bit more at the front of the fuselage, so we move the fuselage slightly backward by 0.25. We then add the combination of the wings and the fuselage.

    32; union       ; 30:31 # Combine the two wings
    33; union     ; 32:4 # Combine the wings with the plane fuselage

This step gives us the following wings and fuselage of the plane.

4. We continue with the addition of the tail wing. The tail wing is made from a combination of two superquadric ellipsoid shapes, one for the vertical plane of the tail wing and one for the horizontal plane of the tail wing. Along the cord of these sections, the shapes are made from elongated ellipsoids with a minor axis of 0.1 and a main axis of 0.3. The span of both shapes is defined using a 6-order power of length 1. The position is adjusted to fit with the tail of the fuselage.

    31; difference  ; 3:2 # Trim off  the right wing

    34; union       ; 33:5 # Combine vertical part of the tail wing with the fuselage
    35; union       ; 34:6 # Combine horizontal part of the tail wing with the fuselage

This step gives us the following plane without engines.

5. The next step is the addition of the two engines. To keep the model relatively simple, the engines are defined by a simple circular superquadric shape with a hole at the center. The radius of the engine is 0.1, and the length is 0.6. The superquadric power used for the superquadric axis is 5. The engine's position is adjusted to fit the plane model, with a 45-degree angle with the center of the fuselage. The hole inside the superquadric shape is obtained using a long cylinder of radius 0.05 centered on the same axis.

    38; difference  ; 10:9 # Hole in the right engine
    39; union       ; 37:38 # Combine right engine with the fuselage and the other engine

This step gives us the following plane without engines.

6.  The final step is to add a link between the engine model and the fuselage of the plane. This is done using another superquadric ellipsoid shape. The ellipse main axis has a length of 0.06, and the minor axis has a length of 0.06. The superquadric axis is of length 0.5. To avoid blocking the hole of the engine with this link to the fuselage, we use the superquadric shape that defines the shape of the engine to trim this superquadric shape. The resulting shape is then combined with the rest of the fuselage. The position is adjusted to fit well with the engine's position.
