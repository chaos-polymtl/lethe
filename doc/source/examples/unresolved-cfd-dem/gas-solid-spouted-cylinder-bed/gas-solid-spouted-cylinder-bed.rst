==================================
Gas-Solid Spouted Cylinder Bed
==================================

This example is an extension of the `Gas-Solid Spouted Bed <../gas-solid-spouted-bed/gas-solid-spouted-bed.html>`_ for a cylindrical geometry. 

----------------------------------
Features
----------------------------------

- Solvers: ``lethe-particles`` and ``lethe-fluid-particles``
- Three-dimensional problem
- Simulates a solid-gas cylinder-shaped spouted bed

---------------------------
Files Used in This Example
---------------------------

Both files mentioned below are located in the example's folder (``examples/unresolved-cfd-dem/gas-solid-spouted-cylinder-bed``).

- Parameter file for particle generation and packing: ``packing-particles.prm``
- Parameter file for CFD-DEM simulation of the spouted bed: ``gas-solid-spouted-cylinder-bed.prm``

-----------------------
Description of the Case
-----------------------

This example simulates the spouting of spherical particles in air in a cylinder. As noted in the example of `Gas-Solid Spouted Bed <../gas-solid-spouted-bed/gas-solid-spouted-bed.html>`_, we use ``lethe-particles`` to fill the bed with particles, and ``lethe-fluid-particles`` as the CFD-DEM solver.

-------------------
DEM Parameter File
-------------------

Here, we will focus only on the parts that have been modified compared to  `Gas-Solid Spouted Bed <../gas-solid-spouted-bed/gas-solid-spouted-bed.html>`_. It is also strongly recommended to visit `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for a detailed description on the concepts and physical meanings of the DEM parameters.

Mesh
~~~~~

In this example, we are simulating a cylinder shaped spouted bed. We introduce the flow through a cylinder of smaller radius that  constitutes the inlet of the bed. A schematic image is shown below;

    :align: center
    :name: geometry
    :height: 15cm 

The geometry of the bed was created using `Pointiwise <../../../tools/pointwise/pointowise.html>`_, and the overview of created mesh is:

.. image:: images/mesh.png

    :height: 10cm

In unresolved CFD-DEM, the averaging volume used to calculate the void fraction needs to be large enough to contain several particles (>10). Since the averaging volume used in the quadrature-centred method is generally related to the cell volume, this introduces a limitation on the cell size. In general, the averaging volume, which in this case is controlled by the cell size, should be approximately three time larger than the diameter of the particles in order to get stable calculation.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type                                = gmsh
      set file name                           = ./mesh/cylinder-spouted-bed.msh
      set expand particle-wall contact search = true
    end

where the file name includes the path to the mesh file. Here, we activate ``expand particle-wall contact search``, which is only used in geometries with concave boundary such as cylinder and sphere. For more details, please refer to `Mesh Parameters Guide <../../../parameters/dem/mesh.html>`_.

Lagrangian Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The physical properties section is almost the same as the previous spouted bed example. Here, parameters for the gravity, the diameter, density, and the number of particles are modified. In this simulation, we use 100,000 particles with a 5 mm diameter. 

.. code-block:: text

    subsection lagrangian physical properties
      set number of particle types = 1
      subsection particle type 0
        set size distribution type            = uniform
        set diameter                          = 0.005
        set number                            = 100000
        set density particles                 = 100
        set young modulus particles           = 10000000
        set poisson ratio particles           = 0.25
        set restitution coefficient particles = 0.97
        set friction coefficient particles    = 0.4
        set rolling friction particles        = 0.3
      end
      set young modulus wall           = 10000000
      set poisson ratio wall           = 0.25
      set restitution coefficient wall = 0.33
      set friction coefficient wall    = 0.2
      set rolling friction wall        = 0.3
    end

Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``insertion info`` subsection manages the insertion of particles. The insertion box parameter is set so that it can fit in the cylinder.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection insertion info
      set insertion method                               = volume
      set inserted number of particles at each time step = 100000
      set insertion frequency                            = 2000
      set insertion box points coordinates               = -0.075, -0.075, 0, 0.075, 0.075, 0.7
      set insertion distance threshold                   = 1.05
      set insertion maximum offset                       = 0.3
      set insertion prn seed                             = 19
    end

Floating Walls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we pack the cylinder with particles, we need to keep them inside and prevent them from falling through the small inlet channel. To do so, we place a floating wall at the bottom of the cylinder, which is :math:`z = 0` plain, as in:

.. code-block:: text

    subsection floating walls
      set number of floating walls = 1
      subsection wall 0
        subsection point on wall
          set x = 0
          set y = 0
          set z = 0
        end
        subsection normal vector
          set nx = 0
          set ny = 0
          set nz = 1
        end
        set start time = 0
        set end time   = 999
      end
    end

---------------------------
Running the DEM Simulation
---------------------------
Launching the simulation is as simple as specifying the executable name and the parameter file. Assuming that the ``lethe-particles`` executable is within your path, the simulation can be launched in parallel as follows:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 8 lethe-particles packing-particles.prm

.. note::
  Running the packing should take approximately 10 hours on 8 cores using Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K.

After the particles have been packed inside the square bed, we can move on to the fluid-particles simulation.


-----------------------
CFD-DEM Parameter File
-----------------------

The CFD-DEM simulation is carried out using the packed bed previously generated. Here we will focus on the modified section as well. We recommend visiting `Unresolved CFD-DEM Parameters Guide <../../../parameters/unresolved-cfd-dem/unresolved-cfd-dem.html>`_ for a detailed description.

Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation is run for 5 seconds with a time step of 0.001 seconds. The time scheme and setting for output is shown as follows.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set method               = bdf2
      set number mesh adapt    = 0
      set output frequency     = 50
      set time end             = 5
      set time step            = 0.001
    end

Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regarding the boundary conditions, we apply slip boundary condition to the wall, a uniform Dirichlet boundary condition at the bottom of the small channel, and outlet to the top of the cylinder. The following schematic figure describes the ID of each boundary and the positon of the floating wall.

.. image:: images/ID.png
    :alt: The geometry and boundary conditions
    :align: center
    :name: ID
    :height: 15cm


We set the inlet velocity to 2.5 m/s, and the background velocity to 0.5 m/s on the bottom of the cylinder as in the previous spouted bed example. The value of beta on the outlet boundary was set to 100, which is relatively high, to stabilize the simulation and prevent backflow.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection boundary conditions
    set time dependent = false
    set number         = 5


    subsection bc 0 #outlet
      set id   = 3
      set type = outlet
      set beta = 100
    end

    subsection bc 1 #inlet
      set id   = 2
      set type = function
      subsection u
        set Function expression = 0
      end
      subsection v
        set Function expression = 0
      end
      subsection w
        set Function expression = 2.5
      end
    end

    subsection bc 2 #wall
      set id = 6
      set type = slip
    end

    subsection bc 3 #channel_wall
      set id = 5
      set type = slip
    end
    
    subsection bc 4   #bed_wall_bottom
      set id   = 4
      set type = function
      subsection u
        set Function expression = 0
      end
      subsection v
        set Function expression = 0
      end
      subsection w
        see Function expression = 0.5
      end
    end
  end

CFD-DEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, we enable grad-div stabilization , and take the time derivative of the void fraction into account.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection cfd-dem
      set grad div                      = true
      set void fraction time derivative = true
      set drag force                    = true
      set buoyancy force                = true
      set shear force                   = true
      set pressure force                = true
      set saffman lift force            = false
      set drag model                    = rong
      set post processing               = true
      set coupling frequency            = 100
      set implicit stabilization        = true
      set grad-div length scale         = 0.26
      set vans model                    = modelA
    end

We set the `grad-div length stabilization` parameter to 0.26, which is the diameter of the geometry. This parameter should be the same length as the characteristic length of the flow. For more detail, please refer to `CFD-DEM parameters <../../../parameters/unresolved-cfd-dem/cfd-dem.html>`_. Also, the additional sections for the CFD-DEM simulations is the void fraction subsection. This subsections is described in detail in the `Void Fraction <../../../parameters/unresolved-cfd-dem/void-fraction.html>`_.

------------------------------
Running the CFD-DEM Simulation
------------------------------

The simulation is run using the ``lethe-fluid-particles`` application. Assuming that the ``lethe-fluid-particles`` executable is within your path, the simulation can be launched as per the following command:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  lethe-fluid-particles gas-solid-spouted-cylinder-bed.prm

or in parallel (where 8 represents the number of processors)

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 8 lethe-particles gas-solid-spouted-cylinder-bed.prm

.. note::
  Running the packing should take approximately 8 days on 8 cores using Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K.

We briefly discuss the results that can be obtained from this example here.

Total Pressure Drop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, we show the simulated pressure drop.

This graph illustrates the variation of pressure drop from 1 second to 5 seconds. We can see the pressure oscillation which is caused by the bubbly state.

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The results are shown in an animation below. As seen, the bubbly flow can be observed on the right side. the color of the particles represents their IDs, allowing for the visualization of the mixing. On the left side, we show the fluid velocity field.
