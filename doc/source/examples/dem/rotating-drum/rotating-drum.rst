This example simulates a rotating drum. We setup this simulation according to the experiments of Alizadeh *et al.* `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.13982>`_ It is recommended to visit `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for more detailed information on the concepts and physical meanings of the parameters in Lethe-DEM.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

226080 particles are first inserted into a cylindrical domain and then start rolling on the cylinder wall because of the rotation of the cylinder. The rotation of the cylinder is applied using a ``rotational`` boundary condition. Because of the large number of particles, this simulation should be launched in parallel mode with load-balancing. The concepts and different types of ``boundary condition`` and load-balancing are explained in this example.

Mesh
~~~~~

In this example, we choose a ``cylinder`` grid type to create a cylinder. Grid arguments are the radius and half-length, respectively. Therefore, the specified grid arguments create a cylinder with a diameter of 0.24 m and a length of 0.36 m. The grid is refined 4 times to reach the desired cell size to particle diameter ratio (see packing in ball example for more details). The ``expand particle-wall contact search`` is used in concave geometries to enable extended particle-wall contact search with boundary faces of neighbor cells for particles located in each boundary cell.

    subsection mesh
  set type                                = dealii
  set grid type                           = subdivided_cylinder
  set grid arguments                      = 4: 0.12:0.18
  set initial refinement                  = 4
  set expand particle-wall contact search = true
    end


Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An insertion box is defined inside the cylindrical domain. 38000 particles are inserted non-uniformly at each insertion step.

  subsection insertion info
    set insertion method                               = non_uniform
    set inserted number of particles at each time step = 38000
    set insertion frequency                            = 25000
    set insertion box minimum x                        = -0.175
    set insertion box minimum y                        = -0.07
    set insertion box minimum z                        = 0
    set insertion box maximum x                        = 0.175
    set insertion box maximum y                        = 0.07
    set insertion box maximum z                        = 0.09
    set insertion distance threshold                   = 1.575
    set insertion random number range                  = 0.025
    set insertion random number seed                   = 19
  end


Lagrangian Physical Properties

The particles (226080 particles) are monodispersed, their diameter and density are 0.003 m and 2500 kg/m3, respectively.

      set gx                       = 0.0
      set gy                       = 0.0
      set gz                       = -9.81

        set restitution coefficient particles = 0.97
        set friction coefficient particles    = 0.3
      end
      set young modulus wall           = 1e7
      set poisson ratio wall           = 0.24
      set restitution coefficient wall = 0.85
      set friction coefficient wall    = 0.35
    end


Model Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Load-balancing updates the distribution of the subdomains between the processes in parallel simulation to achieve better computational performance (less simulation time). Three load-balancing methods are available in Lethe-DEM: ``once``, ``frequent``, or ``dynamic``. Read `this article <https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/1/79>`_ for more information about different load-balancing methods and their performances in various types of DEM simulations.


In the rotating drum simulation, we use a ``frequent`` load-balancing method and repartition the particles every :math:`20 000` iterations.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection model parameters
      subsection contact detection
        set contact detection method                = dynamic
        set dynamic contact search size coefficient = 0.8
        set neighborhood threshold                  = 1.3
      end
      subsection load balancing
        set load balance method = frequent
        set frequency           = 20000
        set step                = 150000
      end
      set particle particle contact force method    = hertz_mindlin_limit_overlap
      set particle wall contact force method        = nonlinear
      set integration method                        = velocity_verlet
    end


DEM Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this subsection, the boundary conditions of the DEM simulation are defined. First of all, the ``number of boundary conditions`` is specified. Then for each boundary condition, its information is defined.  Using ``rotational`` boundary condition exerts imaginary rotational velocity to that boundary. In other words, the boundary does not move, but the particles that have collisions with these walls feel a rotational or translational velocity from the wall. This feature is used in the rotating drum example. The boundary id of the ``cylinder`` side wall, defined with deal.ii grid generator is 4. We set the ``rotational speed`` equal to 11.6 rad/s, and the cylinder should rotate around its axis (`x` direction).

.. code-block:: text

    subsection DEM boundary conditions
      set number of boundary conditions = 1
      subsection boundary condition 0
        set boundary id         = 0
        set type                = rotational
        set rotational speed    = 11.6
        set rotational vector x = 1
        set rotational vector y = 0
        set rotational vector z = 0
      end
    end


Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter file for the loading and for the simulation have different simulation control. We load for two seconds, then simulate for 10 secondes (reaching a final time of 12 seconds).

For the loading the simulation control is:

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set time step         = 1e-5
      set time end          = 2
      set log frequency     = 1000
      set output frequency  = 1000
      set output boundaries = true
      set output path       = ./output/
    end


For the simulation it is:

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set time step        = 1e-5
      set time end         = 12
      set log frequency    = 1000
      set output frequency = 1000
      set output boundaries = false
      set output path       = ./output/
    end


----------------------
Running the Simulation
----------------------
This simulation can be launched in two steps. First the particles need to be loaded (here we use 8 cores):

.. code-block:: text

  mpirun -np 8 dem load-rotating-drum.prm

Then we run the simulation with the rotating walls:

.. code-block:: text

  mpirun -np 8 dem rotating-drum.prm

.. warning::
  In this example, particles insertion requires approximately 50 minutes, while simulating their motion requires additional 8 hours on 8 cores. The high computational cost is due to the large number of particles and the long duration of the simulation.
