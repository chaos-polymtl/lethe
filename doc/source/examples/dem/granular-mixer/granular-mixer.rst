==================================
Granular Mixer
==================================

This example simulates the packing and mixing of particles in a mixer with a pitched-blade impeller. It is recommended to visit `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for more detailed information on the concepts and physical meanings of the parameters in Lethe-DEM.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

This simulation consists of two stages: packing (0-0.5 s) and mixing (0.5-5 s) of particles. There are two types of particles in this simulation (bidispersed system), that are inserted on top of each other during the packing stage. The size and properties of the two particle types are the same, we only need to define two particle types to make the visualization easier during post-processing. At :math:`t=0.5` s, the pitched-blade impeller starts rotating with an angular velocity of 6 rad/s and mixes the particles.

Mesh
~~~~~

The background mesh (mixer body) is created using dealii ``subdivided_cylinder``.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type                = dealii
      set grid type           = subdivided_cylinder
      set grid arguments      = 2 : 0.05 : 0.055
      set initial refinement  = 3
    end

Lagrangian Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned earlier, there are two types of particles with the same size and properties.

    subsection lagrangian physical properties
      set gx                                  = -9.81

      set gz                                  = 0.0
      set number of particle types            = 2
      subsection particle type 0

        set young modulus particles         	  = 1e6
        set poisson ratio particles             = 0.5
        set restitution coefficient particles   = 0.5
        set friction coefficient particles      = 0.5
      end
      subsection particle type 1
        set size distribution type              = uniform
        set diameter                            = 0.0015
        set number                              = 23500
        set density particles                   = 1500
        set young modulus particles             = 1e6
        set poisson ratio particles             = 0.5
        set restitution coefficient particles   = 0.5
        set friction coefficient particles      = 0.5
      end
      set young modulus wall                  = 1e6
      set poisson ratio wall                  = 0.5
      set restitution coefficient wall        = 0.5
      set friction coefficient wall           = 0.5
    end


Solid Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this subsection, the floating meshes are defined. We can use dealii or gmsh to create the floating meshes. At the moment, solid objects (floating meshes) in Lethe have to be defined using triangular (simplex) meshes. Only triangular 2D meshes of 3D surfaces in the dem_3d solver are presently supported. Quadrilateral 2D meshes of 3D surfaces and 1D mesh of 2D surfaces are not supported at the moment. For each floating mesh, we need to specify a ``translational velocity``, an ``angular velocity``, and a ``center of rotation``. In this example, we only need an angular motion of the impeller. Note that the ``center of rotation`` of the impeller is at 0, 0, 0.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection solid objects
      set number of solids = 1
      subsection solid object 0
        subsection mesh
          set type               = gmsh
          set file name          = pitched-blade-impeller.msh
          set simplex            = true
          set initial refinement = 0
        end
    
        subsection translational velocity
          set Function expression = 0 ; 0 ; 0
        end
        subsection angular velocity
          set Function expression = if(t>0.5,6,0) ; 0 ; 0
        end
    
        subsection center of rotation
          # X COR
          set x = 0
          # Y COR
          set y = 0
          # Z COR
          set z = 0
        end
      end
    end

Running the Simulation
----------------------
This simulation can be launched by (in parallel mode on 8 processes):

.. code-block:: text

  mpirun -np 8 dem_3d granular-mixer.prm

.. warning::
	This example takes approximately 2 hours on 8 cores.

Possibility for Extension
-----------------------------

The same simulation can be carried out with particles of different sizes and properties to study segregation.
