Description of the Case
-----------------------

This example simulates the dam-break flow of a dry powder. First, a packing of particles is generated by inserting particles behind a sluice gate. After 0.5s, the sluice gate rises and the particles are able to flow freely, producing a dam-break flow. We compare the results we obtain with those of Evangelista et al. `[1] <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefania-Evangelista/publication/268486214_Dam-break_dry_granular_flows_Experimental_and_numerical_analysis/links/54e2ff590cf2c3e7d2d523a6/Dam-break-dry-granular-flows-Experimental-and-numerical-analysis.pdf>`_. To ensure that the simulation remains computationally efficient, we will scale-up the sand particles used by Evangelista et al. from a diameter of 1.6mm to 10mm. This reduces their number by a factor of approximately 250x. We first simulate case B1 of Evangelista et al., with a bed length of 60cm and bed height of 20cm. As an extension, we also simulate a bed height of 40cm (case B3).

Mesh
~~~~~

The domain we simulate is a rectangular box which is :math:`2\times0.4\times0.4` meters and is made using the deal.ii grid generator.  The grid is refined 4 times using the ``set initial refinement`` parameter.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection mesh
    set type               = dealii
    set grid type          = subdivided_hyper_rectangle
    set grid arguments     = 5,1,1 : 0,0,0 : 2,0.4,0.4 : false
    set initial refinement = 4
  end

Lagrangian Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The particles are mono dispersed with a radius of 0.005 m and a density of 2560 :math:`kg/m^3`, respectively. We insert 60k particles to ensure an initial height of 0.2m in order to match the B1 experiment of Evangelista et al.. The friction coefficient and the rolling coefficient are the most important parameters in this simulation, since they control the final repose angle of the particles as well as the speed of the progression of the dam-break flow. Since sand is generally non-spherical, we choose relatively high values for the friction and the rolling friction coefficients.

    set rolling friction wall        = 0.3
  end


Model Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we use the ``frequent`` load balancing method to ensure that the division of the domain amongst the various processing cores follow the particles.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection model parameters
    subsection contact detection
      set contact detection method                = dynamic
      set dynamic contact search size coefficient = 0.9

    end

    set particle wall contact force method      = nonlinear
    set integration method                      = velocity_verlet
  end

Particle Insertion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An insertion box is defined inside the rectangular box. 60 000 particles are inserted behind the sluice gate which is located at :math:`x=0.6`. It is important to note the size of the insertion box to make sure it is completely inside our geometry. Otherwise, particles will be lost during the insertion stage.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection insertion info
    set insertion method                               = non_uniform

    set insertion distance threshold                   = 1.075
    set insertion random number range                  = 0.025
    set insertion random number seed                   = 19
  end


Moving Solid Object
----------------------------

The sluice gate which prevents the particle from floating is made of a 3D surface mesh of a flat wall. This is handled using the solid objects parameters. We insert one solid object which is generated using GMSH. To parametrize the motion of the sluice gate, we set its translational velocity to :math:`\mathbf{v}=[0,1,0]^T \forall t \in [0.5,0.7]s` and we keep it static otherwise. This ensures that the sluice gate moves upward between 0.5 and 0.7s and stops moving afterwards. To ensure maximal computational efficiency, it is important to minimize the number of triangles used in the surface meshes that represent moving objects.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection solid objects
  set number of solids = 1
    subsection solid object 0
      subsection mesh
        set type               = gmsh
        set file name          = square.msh
        set simplex            = true
        set initial refinement = 0
      end
  
      subsection translational velocity
        set Function expression = 0 ; if(t>0.5,if(t<0.7,1,0),0) ; 0
      end
      subsection angular velocity
        set Function expression = 0 ; 0  ; 0
      end
    end
  end


Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation runs for 2 seconds of real time. We output the simulation results every 500 iterations.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection simulation control
    set time step         = 5e-5
    set time end          = 2
    set log frequency     = 500
    set output frequency  = 500
    set output path       = ./output/
    set output boundaries = true
  end
    


-----------------------
Running the Simulation
-----------------------

The simulation is launched using a single input file for the insertion of the particles, the opening of the sluice gate and the granular motion of the particles.

Results for :math:`H=20 \ \text{cm}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following movie displays the dam-break flow:

The following image compares the final repose angle of the particles with the results of Evangelista et al. We note the good agreement between the two. Evangelista et al. also found experimentally that the particle height profile varied from :math:`0.2m` at :math:`x=0.4m` to :math:`\approx 0.025m` at :math:`x=0.8m` which is in good agreement with what we observe here.

Results for :math:`H=40 \ \text{cm}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following image compares the final granular profile of the particles with the results of Evangelista et al (illustrated using a magenta curve). We note the good agreement between the two, except for the fact that a few particles have moved further away (:math:`x>1.1m`) than the one from the experiments of Evangelista et al. This is a consequence of the fact that we have used larger particles to simulate the case.

----------------------------
Possibilities for Extension
----------------------------

- Study the impact of the friction and rolling friction coefficients on the dam-break flow.
- Change the height of the bed to 30cm or 50m and try to reproduce the other experiments of Evangelista et al.
- Use smaller particles and reproduce the full experiment of Evagenlista et al.
