Packing in Ball

This example is the three-dimensional version of the ``packing_in_circle`` example. It is recommended to visit `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for more detailed information on the concepts and physical meanings of the parameters in Lethe-DEM.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

Packing in ball example is the three-dimensional version of the packing in circle example.

.. warning::
	Two-dimensional DEM solver (dem_2d) is not an accurate model, since several phenomena including torque on particles are intrinsically three-dimensional. dem_2d solver may only be used for simple basic analyses before performing three-dimensional simulations with dem_3d solver becomes necessary.

Parameter File
--------------

The parameter file of packing in ball example is very similar to packing in circle example. We only explain the parts that are different because of the three-dimensional example.

Mesh
~~~~~

In a three-dimensional simulation, ``hyper_ball`` creates a three-dimensional ball (hollow sphere). Note that the first grid argument, which is the center of the triangulation, has three components (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). The ``expand particle-wall contact search`` is used in concave geometries to enable particle-wall contact search with boundary faces of neighbor cells for particles located in each boundary cell.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
      set type                                = dealii
      set grid type                           = hyper_ball
      set grid arguments                      = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 : 0.1 : false
      set initial refinement                  = 3
      set expand particle-wall contact search = true
    end


Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a three-dimensional simulation, we have to define the minimum and maximum dimensions of the insertion box with three components in `x`, `y`, and `z` directions.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection insertion info
      set insertion method                               = non_uniform
      set inserted number of particles at each time step = 1000
      set insertion frequency                            = 150000
      set insertion box minimum x                        = -0.05
      set insertion box minimum y                        = -0.05
      set insertion box minimum z                        = -0.03
      set insertion box maximum x                        = 0.05
      set insertion box maximum y                        = 0.05
      set insertion box maximum z                        = 0.07
      set insertion distance threshold                   = 2
      set insertion random number range                  = 0.75
      set insertion random number seed                   = 19
    end


Lagrangian Physical Properties

    subsection model parameters
      subsection contact detection
        set contact detection method                = dynamic
        set dynamic contact search size coefficient = 0.7

    subsection simulation control
      set time step        = 1e-6
      set time end         = 1

    end

Running the Simulation
----------------------

This simulation can be launched by:

.. code-block:: text

  dem_3d packing-in-ball.prm

We can also launch this simulation in parallel mode. For example, to launch the simulation on 8 processes:

.. code-block:: text

  mpirun -np 8 dem_3d packing-in-ball.prm

.. note::
	The parallel simulations are generally faster than simulations on a single process. However, to leverage the full performance of a parallel simulation, it should be performed with a load-balancing strategy throughout the simulation. Load-balancing is explained in the `next example <../rotating-drum/rotating-drum.html>`_.
