==================================
Rectangular Hopper
==================================

This example simulates the filling and discharging of particles in a rectangular hopper.
We set up this simulation based on the simulation of Anand et al. `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.015>`_. It is recommended to visit `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for more detailed information on the concepts and physical meanings of the parameters in Lethe-DEM.
The main example does not use periodic boundary conditions in the depth of the hopper like article, but an extended case, presented at the end, does.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

This simulation consists of two stages: filling (0-4 s) and discharge (4-7.5 s) of particles. Anand et al. uses periodic boundaries in the z axis allowing to use a thin width for simulation.
In the main example, we do not consider periodic boundaries. To minimize the impact of collision of particle with walls along the z axis, the width and the number of particle were multiplied by 6 (40740 particles instead of 6790). This corresponds to a width of 15 times the particle diameter.

Mesh
~~~~~

The mesh is a hopper with 90° angle generated with GMSH having a top part for the filling and a bottom part which acts as a collector of the particle.
The geometry follow the Anand et al. `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.015>`_ base case and was handled in order to generate a structured mesh.

Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An insertion box is defined inside and the top part of the hopper. The inserted number of particles per time step is chosen to be a factor of the total number of particle. In this case, 14 insertion steps are required to fill up the hopper with particles.

    end


Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time end of the simulation is 7.5 where most of the particles are discharged and the DEM time step is 1e-5 s which corresponds to 2.9% of Rayleigh time step.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set time step        = 1e-5
      set time end         = 7.5
      set log frequency    = 1000
      set output frequency = 1000
      set output path      = ./output/
      set output name      = hopper
    end


Floating Walls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Floating wall in this example is handled as explained in the `Silo example <../silo/silo.html>`_.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection floating walls
      set number of floating walls = 1
      subsection wall 0
        subsection point on wall
          set x = 0

    end


----------------------
Running the Simulation
----------------------
This simulation can be launched by

.. code-block:: text

  mpirun -np 8 dem_3d hopper.prm


---------------
Post-processing
---------------
A Python post-processing code called ``hopper_post_processing.py`` is provided with this example. It is used to measure the flow rate of particles.

It also compares the data generated by the simulation to data from Anand et al. `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.015>`_.

It is possible to run the post-processing code with the following line. The arguments are the simulation path and the prm file name.

.. code-block:: text

    python3 hopper_post_processing.py ./ hopper.prm


.. note:: 

  The ``hopper_post_processing.py`` uses the ``lethe_pyvista_tools.py`` module. For more information about the module, refer to the `Small rotating drum post-processing example <../small-scale-rotating-drum-post-processing/small-scale-rotating-drum-post-processing.html>`_

Results Post-processing
-----------------------
Mass flow rate results after post-processing and comparison with the results of Anand et al. `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.015>`_ for the base case of the hooper with a 90° angle.

-------
Results
-------
As seen in the following figure, the simulation was not run until all the particles are discharged in the bottom part.
Since the mass flow rate is constant during the discharge, simulating the very end is not necessary.
The simulated mass discharging rate is 84.94 g/s.

Case with Periodic Boundary Conditions
--------------------------------------
Periodic boundary conditions feature was not implemented when this example was created. Since it is now, this example is now extended to show how to use it. The original case in Anand et al. `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.015>`_ did use periodic boundaries.
The modifications on the parameters of the previous example is the mesh thickness and the number of particles and also the addition of the boundary condition section.

Mesh
~~~~

The hopper in this case has the same shape with a depth reduces by a factor of 6. The depth is the same than the article and a new GMSH file is used.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection mesh
        set type                                = gmsh
        set file name                           = hopper_structured_periodic.msh
        set initial refinement                  = 1
        set expand particle-wall contact search = false
        set check diamond cells                 = true
    end

Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous example did not need any parameters on a section for the boundary conditions since all walls are treated as solid boundaries by default.
We need to specify which boundaries are periodic and the perpendicular direction, here the periodic ids are 0 and 1 and the axis is z, corresponding to value of 2.
The feature only works with one pair of periodic boundaries.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection DEM boundary conditions
        set number of boundary conditions = 1

        subsection boundary condition 0
            set type                      = periodic
            set periodic id 0             = 0
            set periodic id 1             = 1
            set periodic direction        = 2
        end
    end

Lagrangian Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The total number of particles of this simulation is 6790: 6 times less than the previous example.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection lagrangian physical properties
        set gx                       = 0.0

            set size distribution type            = uniform
            set diameter                          = 0.00224
            set number                            = 6790
            set density particles                 = 2500
            set young modulus particles           = 1e6
            set poisson ratio particles           = 0.3
            set restitution coefficient particles = 0.94
            set friction coefficient particles    = 0.2
            set rolling friction particles        = 0.09
        end
        set young modulus wall           = 1e6
        set poisson ratio wall           = 0.3
        set friction coefficient wall    = 0.2
        set restitution coefficient wall = 0.9
        set rolling friction wall        = 0.09
    end

Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the geometry of the mesh and the number of the particles are not the same, the insertion info have to be modified according to the new domain of the mesh with an inserted number of particles corresponding to the new number.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection insertion info
        set insertion method                               = non_uniform
        set inserted number of particles at each time step = 2910
        set insertion frequency                            = 25000
        set insertion box minimum x                        = -0.1030
        set insertion box minimum y                        = 0.10644
        set insertion box minimum z                        = .00224
        set insertion box maximum x                        = 0.1030
        set insertion box maximum y                        = 0.16020
        set insertion box maximum z                        = 0.03136
        set insertion distance threshold                   = 1.5
        set insertion random number range                  = 0.1
        set insertion random number seed                   = 20
    end

Results Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is the comparison of the results from the original simulation with Lethe DEM, the simulation with periodic boundary conditions with Lethe and the results from Anand et al. paper.
The simulated mass discharging rate is 85.09 g/s from the original simulation and 91.73 g/s with PBC. Also, the run time of the simulation goes from about 1 hours and 30 minutes to 10 minutes on 8 cores with an Intel i7-11700K.
