==================================
Rectangular hopper
==================================

This example simulates the filling and discharge of particles in a rectangular hopper.
We set up this simulation based on the simulation of Anand et al. `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2008.08.015>`_. It is recommended to visit `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for more detailed information on the concepts and physical meanings of the parameters in Lethe-DEM.

Features
----------------------------------
- Solvers: ``dem_3d``
- Floating walls
- Gmsh grids
- Python post-processing script using PyVista

Description of the case
-----------------------

This simulation consists of two stages: filling (0-4 s) and discharge (4-7.5 s) of particles. Anand et al. uses periodic boundaries in the z axis allowing to use a thin width for simulation. This case do not use periodic boundary in Lethe. Prior minimizing the impact of collision of particle with walls in z axis, the width and the number of particle were multiplied 6 times. This corresponds to a width of 15 times the particle diameter.

Mesh
~~~~~

The mesh is a hopper with 90Â° angle generated with GMSH having a top part for the filling and a bottom part which acts as a collector of the particle.

        set expand particle-wall contact search = false
        set check diamond cells                 = true
    end


Insertion info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An insertion box is defined inside and the top part of the hopper. The inserted number is choose to be a factor of the total number of particle. In this case, 14 insertion step is require to fill up the hopper with particles.
