==================================
Bunny Drill
==================================

This example simulates the drilling motion of a bunny within a bed of particles. It illustrates that the DEM module of Lethe can simulate complex moving objects and is a testament to our love of lagomorphs. Do not worry friend, no bunnies were hurt in the making of this example!

Mesh
~~~~~

The mesh is a cylinder generated using the deal.II grid generator.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection mesh
    set type               = cylinder
    set grid type          = balanced
    set grid arguments     = 6 : 0.10 : 0.25
    set initial refinement = 2
  end

Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An insertion plane is defined just below the bunny drill. The insertion plane is a useful mechanism to insert particles in a simulation in which the available volume is limited for rectangular box insertion. To ensure a more rapid insertion, we also give an initial velocity to the particles. We set ``insertion maximum offset = 0`` so that the particles inserted are all exactly on the insertion plane.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection insertion info
    set insertion method                               = plane
    set inserted number of particles at each time step = 200
    set insertion frequency                            = 4000
    set insertion plane point                          = 0.025, 0, 0
    set insertion plane normal vector                  = -1, 0, 0
    set insertion maximum offset                       = 0
    set insertion prn seed                             = 19
    set initial velocity                               = -0.1, 0.0, 0.0
  end


Lagrangian Physical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The total number of particles in this simulation is 8000. All particles have a diameter of 10 mm. The particles are relatively stiff, with a Young Modulus of :math:`E=10^7` to ensure that the overlap between the bunny drill and the particles does not become sufficiently large to allow particles to *jump through* the bunny.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection lagrangian physical properties
    set g                        = -9.81, 0, 0
    set number of particle types = 1
    subsection particle type 0
      set size distribution type            = uniform
      set diameter                          = 0.01
      set number of particles               = 8000
      set density particles                 = 2560
      set young modulus particles           = 1e7
      set poisson ratio particles           = 0.3
      set restitution coefficient particles = 0.9
      set friction coefficient particles    = 0.2
      set rolling friction particles        = 0.3
    end
    set young modulus wall           = 1e7
    set poisson ratio wall           = 0.2
    set restitution coefficient wall = 0.9
    set friction coefficient wall    = 0.5
    set rolling friction wall        = 0.1
  end



Simulation Control (Loading)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time end of the simulation is 2 seconds after all particles have been loaded.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection simulation control
    set time step         = 5e-6
    set time end          = 2
    set log frequency     = 1000
    set output frequency  = 1000
    set output path       = ./output/
    set output boundaries = true
  end

Simulation Control (Drilling)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time end of the simulation is 4.75 seconds after which the bunny has done one back-and-forth drilling motion.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection simulation control
    set time step         = 5e-6
    set time end          = 4.75
    set log frequency     = 1000
    set output frequency  = 1000
    set output path       = ./output/
    set output boundaries = true
  end



Solid Objects (Drilling)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bunny is defined using the solid objects feature of Lethe. The surface mesh of the bunny is a GMSH file. The translational velocity is defined to have a periodic motion along the axis of the cylinder and the bunny is rotating at a constant angular velocity once the particles have been loaded (:math:`t>2\text{s}`) . This complex drilling motion is fully parametrized from the input file using the function parser of the translational and the angular velocity of the solid object.

.. code-block:: text

  subsection solid objects
    set number of solids = 1
    subsection solid object 0
      subsection mesh
        set type                   = gmsh
        set file name              = bunny-low-poly.msh
        set simplex                = true
        set initial rotation axis  = 0, 1, 0
        set initial rotation angle = 1.5708 # pi/2
        set initial translation    = 0.05, 0, 0.035
      end
      subsection translational velocity
        set Function expression = if (t>2,-0.27*sin(0.8*3.1416*(t-2)),0) ; 0 ; 0
      end
      subsection angular velocity
        set Function expression = if (t>2,31.42,0) ; 0 ; 0
      end
    end
  end


----------------------
Running the Simulation
----------------------
The loading can be simulated using the following command:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 8 lethe-particles bunny-drill-loading.prm

Whereas the drilling is launched after the loading using:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 8 lethe-particles bunny-drill.prm


-------
Results
-------
As seen in the following two animations, the bunny drills into the particles which generates a complex motion within the granular matter. There is not much more to say here, it is a bunny drill.

The first animation displays the drill with the entirety of the particles. It is difficult to see the dynamics of the mighty bunny within these circumstances.

The following animation displays the drill with half of the particles clipped. Here we can clearly see the bunny in action.

----------------------------
Possibilities for Extension
----------------------------

- Use finer particles to see if the drilling dynamics are affected by the particle size.
- Use an STL of an alternative animal. Although we believe lagomorphs are amazing, we are also fans of mustelidae (e.g., otters) and chinchillidae (e.g., chinchillas or, even better, viscachas). Feel free to replace the drill with your favorite animal and to send us your animation to lethe.cfd@gmail.com.
