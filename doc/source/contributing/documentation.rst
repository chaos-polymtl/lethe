Build
-----

Setup
^^^^^

To build the doc on your personal machine, you'll need the following requirements:

* Python v3.x
* make
* Sphinx v4.x

To install required system packages:

.. code-block:: shell
  :class: copy-button

  sudo apt-get install python3 build-essential

To install Sphinx globally:

.. code-block:: shell
  :class: copy-button

  pip install 'sphinx==7.*'

To install additional packages:

.. code-block:: shell
  :class: copy-button

  pip install sphinx-copybutton

and:

.. code-block:: shell
  :class: copy-button

  sudo apt-get install graphviz

Then, install the Sphinx requirements:

.. code-block:: shell
  :class: copy-button

  pip install -r doc/requirements.txt

Build HTML
^^^^^^^^^^

To build standalone HTML files like the CI would, enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell
  :class: copy-button

  cd doc
  make html

The generated files should be in the ``build/html`` directory. Open ``index.html`` in a browser to view the rendered documents.

General Rules and Format
------------------------

Throughout the documentation, you may notice that the different pages follow a certain format to ensure uniformity and help users to navigate more fluidly. Here are the different elements that must be considered when contributing to the documentation of Lethe:

- Titles and subtitles must be capitalized following the `Chicago Manual of Style <https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html>`_:

  - First and last words of the title/subtitle must be capitalized.
  - Capitalize:

    - adjectives (e.g., Small, Large)
    - adverbs (e.g., Warmly, Rapidly)
    - nouns (e.g., Ball, Cylinder)
    - pronouns (e.g., They, She, He)
    - subordinating conjunction when fewer than 5 letters (e.g., When, Once)
    - verbs (e.g., Melt, Create)

  - **Do not** capitalize:

    - articles (e.g., a, an, the)
    - coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and, but, for)
    - prepositions (e.g., at, by, to)
    - second word after a hyphenated prefix (e.g., Mid-, Non-) in compound modifiers (e.g., Mid-year, Non-linear)
    - words with less than four letters

  .. tip::

    If you are unsure of the capitalization of your title or subtitle, you can use `online tools <https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/>`_ to help you out.

- Examples generally contain the following subsections in the listed order:

  - **Features** lists features of the example.
  - **Files Used in This Examples** lists files used in the example in alphabetical order.
  - **Description of the Case** describes the system studied in the example.
  - **Parameter File** describes the different parameter subsections involved in the example. Each subsection of interest of the parameter file begins with its name as a sub-heading.
  - **Running the Simulation** displays the command used to run the example and gives an scale of the running duration.
  - **Results** or **Results and Discussion** displays results of the simulation and comments on them.
  - **Possibility for Extension** lists different interesting ways to extend the example.
  - **References** lists references used in the example in IEEE referencing style format.

    .. seealso::

      More information on the IEEE referencing style can be found in the `IEEE Reference Guide <https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf>`_.

      Here is an example of how references should appear in:

      - In-text citation:

        The *Lethe: An open-source parallel high-order adaptative CFD solver for incompressible flows* article by Blais *et al.* [#blais2020]_ is used as an example.

      - The ``References`` list:

        .. [#blais2020] \B. Blais *et al.* “Lethe: An open-source parallel high-order adaptative CFD solver for incompressible flows,” *SoftwareX*, vol. 12, pp. 100579, Jul. 2020, doi: `10.1016/j.softx.2020.100579 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100579>`_.\

        Following the format:

        .. container::

          [#AuthorYear] A. A. Author, "Name of the paper," *Abbreviated Title of the Journal*, vol. x, no. x, pp. xxx-xxx, Abbreviated month, year, doi: xxx.

        The code in the documentation should be formatted as follows:

        .. code-block:: RST

           .. [#blais2020] \B. Blais *et al.* “Lethe: An open-source parallel high-order adaptative CFD solver for incompressible flows,” *SoftwareX*, vol. 12, pp. 100579, Jul. 2020, doi: `10.1016/j.softx.2020.100579 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100579>`_.\"""

        .. Important::

          When citing, the "*et al.*" notation is used in:

          - In-text citation if there are three or more authors for a given reference.
          - The ``References`` list if there are more than six authors for a given reference.

  .. note::

    These subheadings can take the singular or plural form depending on the example. Feel free to adapt them and add more layers to structure your own examples.

Equations
---------

Sphinx can render equations using the MathJax backend.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: RST

    .. math::
        i^2=-1

gives:

.. math::

   i^2=-1


.. code-block:: RST

    .. math::
        df=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}

gives:

.. math::

   df=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}

.. code-block:: RST

    .. math::
        \rho\left[\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial t} + \bar{u}\cdot\bar{\nabla} \bar{u} \right] = - \bar{\nabla} \bar{p} + \mu \bar{\nabla}^2 \bar{u} + \rho \bar{g}

gives: 

.. math::
    \rho\left[\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial t} + \bar{u}\cdot\bar{\nabla} \bar{u} \right] = - \bar{\nabla} \bar{p} + \mu \bar{\nabla}^2 \bar{u} + \rho \bar{g}

Code
----

Python syntax highlight: 

.. code-block:: RST

    .. code-block:: python
        your code

C++ syntax highlight: 

.. code-block:: RST

    .. code-block:: cpp
        your code

The code block in text mode is commonly used in the examples to show sections of a parameter file:

.. code-block:: RST

    .. code-block:: text
        your code

.. warning::
    Keep in mind the proper indentation of the sections of the parameter file. We recommend the use of the ``prmindent`` script located in the ``contrib/utilities`` folder before copying sections of a parameter file to the documentation. Do NOT use tabs in these blocks of code, as they will not be recognized, leading to the wrong indentation.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: RST

    .. code-block:: python
        for i in range(5):
        print(i)

gives:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(5):
    print(i)

.. code-block:: RST

    .. code-block:: cpp
        for (int i = 0 ; i<5 ; i++) {
            std::cout << i << std::endl;
        }

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (int i = 0 ; i<5 ; i++) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }

Tables
------

.. code-block:: RST

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - My
            - Beautiful
            - Table
        * - tables
            - are
            - rendered
        * - with
            - automatic
            - strip

Gives:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - My
     - Beautiful
     - Table
   * - tables
     - are
     - rendered
   * - with
     - automatic
     - strip
