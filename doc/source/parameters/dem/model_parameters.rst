Particle-particle contact search is a costly operation in DEM simulations. If the contact detection is not carried out as optimally as possible, DEM simulations can be slowed down significantly. Lethe supports two mechanisms to detect the contact between particles.
 
* By setting ``contact detection method = constant``. contact search will be carried out at constant frequency (every ``contact detection frequency`` iterations). Normally, the ``contact detection frequency`` should be a value between 5 and 50. The contact frequency should be chosen such that the particles do not travel more than half a cell between two contact detection. Small values of ``contact detection frequency`` lead to long simulation times, while large values of ``contact detection frequency`` may lead to late detection of collisions. Late detection of collisions can result in very large particles velocities (popcorn jump of particles in a simulation) or particles leaving the simulation domain.

* By setting ``contact detection method = dynamic``, Lethe-DEM rebuilds the contact lists automatically. In this mode, Lethe-DEM stores the displacements of each particle in the simulation since the last contact detection. If the maximum displacement of a particle exceeds the smallest contact search criterion (explained in the following), then the iteration is a contact search iteration and the contact list is rebuilt.

The smallest contact search criterion is the minimum of the smallest cell size in the triangulation or the radius of the spherical region in fine search (explained in the following), and it is defined as:
 
.. math::
    \phi=\min({d_c^{min}-r_p^{max},\epsilon(\alpha-1)r_p^{max}})

where :math:`{\phi}`, :math:`{d_c^{min}}`, :math:`{r_p^{max}}`, :math:`{\epsilon}`, and :math:`{\alpha}` denote smallest contact search criterion, minimum cell size (in the triangulation), maximum particle radius (in polydisperse simulations), ``dynamic contact search size coefficient``, and ``neighborhood threshold``.

* ``dynamic contact search size coefficient``, as illustrated in the equation above, is a safety factor to ensure the late detection of particles will not happen in the simulations with ``dynamic`` contact search; and its value should be defined generally in the range of 0.5-1. 0.5 is a rather conservative value for ``dynamic contact search size coefficient``.

To optimize the computational performance of Lethe-DEM, the contact search is performed in two steps (broad and fine contact searches). In broad contact search, neighbor particles in adjacent cells are stored in a list. Then this list of adjacent particles is refined once more in the fine search. More information about the contact search algorithm in Lethe-DEM can be found `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09576>`_ . In the fine search, the particles (from the output list of broad search) which are located in a spherical region around each particle are stored in another list and sent to force calculation class. The diameter of this spherical region :math:`{D}` around each particle is defined as:

.. math::
    D={\alpha}d_p^{max}

where :math:`{d_p^{max}}` denotes the maximum particle size in the simulation.

* According to the definition of the spherical region in the fine search and contact force (equation above), the value of the ``neighborhood threshold`` :math:`{\alpha}` must be larger than 1. It is generally defined in the range of 1.3-1.5.

* Load-balancing updates the distribution of the subdomains between the processes in parallel simulation to achieve better computational performance (less simulation time). Three load-balancing methods are available in Lethe-DEM: ``once``, ``frequent``, or ``dynamic``. Read here for more information about different load-balancing methods and their performances in various types of DEM simulations. The total weight of each cell with particles in load-balancing is defined as:

.. math::
    W=1000+W_pn_p

where :math:`{W_p}` is the ``particle weight`` and :math:`{n_p}` is the number of particles in the cell. 1000 is the default weight assigned to one cell.

Selecting ``load balance method = once``, requires defining the step at which the code calls load balancing (``load balance step``). ``load balance method = frequent`` requires defining ``load balance frequency``, and in ``load balance method = frequent``, we should define ``threshold`` and ``dynamic check frequency``. In ``dynamic`` load balancing, the code checks the distribution of particles among the processors, every ``dynamic check frequency`` steps, and if

.. math::
    L_{max}-L_{min}>{\beta}\bar{L}

it executes a load balancing. :math:`{L}` and :math:`{\beta}` denote computational load on a process and ``threshold``, respectively.

* Four ``particle particle contact models`` are available in Lethe-DEM (``hertz_mindlin_limit_overlap``, ``hertz_mindlin_limit_force``, ``hertz``, and ``linear``). ``hertz_mindlin_limit_overlap`` and ``hertz_mindlin_limit_force`` are non-linear contact models in which the stiffness and damping forces in both normal and tangential directions are considered. The only difference between these models is in their limiting method of the tangential force during gross sliding (where the tangential force exceeds the coulomb's limit). In ``hertz_mindlin_limit_overlap`` model, Lethe-DEM limits the tangential overlap and with limiting the overlap, the tangential force is limited; while in ``hertz_mindlin_limit_force`` model, the tangential force is limited directly without limiting the tangential overlap. ``hertz`` is another non-linear model in which the damping force is not considered in the tangential direction and the tangential force is limited in gross sliding. Lethe-DEM also has a ``linear`` contact model (the stiffness and damping forces are linear functions of overlap and relative velocity, respectively).

* Lethe-DEM has two ``linear`` and ``non-linear`` particle-wall models.

* ``euler`` (1st order) and ``velocity-verlet`` (2nd order) are the available integration methods in Lethe-DEM.

* Three rolling resistance models are available in Lethe-DEM: ``no_resistance``, ``constant_resistance``, ``viscous_resistance``.

* ``dynamic disabling contacts`` subsection controls the disabling contact mechanism for performance enhancement. This feature dynamically searches for cells with low particle motion (granular temperature), disabling the computation of contacts for particles within these cells.
  ``enable dynamic disabling contacts`` enables the feature, ``granular temperature threshold`` is the threshold of the granular temperature below which the contacts are disabled, and ``solid fraction threshold`` is the minimum solid fraction of the cell in which the contacts may be disabled.
  Some parameters in the load balance section may be used to improve the performance of the dynamic disabling contacts feature using the dynamic load balancing.
  Note: The ``load balance method`` may be set to ``dynamic_with_disabling_contacts`` and factors of the weight of the cells by mobility status (only active and inactive, mobile factor is always 1) may be adjusted using the ``load balance active weight factor`` and ``load balance inactive weight factor`` parameters.
