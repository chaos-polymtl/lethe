Post-processing
===============

Lethe has built-in post-processing capabilities. All post-processing results are written as VTU, PTVU, and/or PVD files. 

The post-processing subsection of the ``.prm`` file is according to the following example:

.. code-block:: text

 subsection post-processing
  # Enable output of grid, granular temperature, and particles' average velocity
  set Lagrangian post-processing = false
  # Enable output of force chains
  set force chains = false
 end

.. note::
 By default, post-processing options are set to ``false`` to reduce the number of files generated.

--------------------------
Lagrangian post-processing
--------------------------
The ``Lagrangian post-processing`` enables VTU files output generated with the same ``output frequency`` as the particles' results (see the :doc:`../dem/simulation_control` section of this guide). The name of the generated files is set by the ``output name`` parameter in the simulation_control section plus the suffix ``-postprocess_data``. The files include:

* The grid of the domain, with the distribution of the subdomains generated by the load balance (more information about load balancing is provided in the :doc:`../dem/model_parameters` section of this guide).

* The spatial average of the particle's velocity (in x, y, z and its norm) for each cell.

* The granular temperature for each cell.

.. important::
 The particles' average velocity and the granular temperature are cell based results calculated instantaneously at each outputting time-step. This means that they are only instantaneous spatial averages, i.e, DO NOT correspond to temporal averages measured between the outputs. For a higher resolution of the results in time, we recommend the use of a lower ``output frequency`` (:doc:`../dem/simulation_control`).

----------------------------
Force chains post-processing
----------------------------
The ``force chains`` feature enables VTU, PTVU, and PVD files to visualize force chains between particles. The name of the generated files is set by the ``output name`` parameter in the simulation_control section plus the suffix ``-force_chains``. The files include:

* Lines to represent normal forces between particles in contact (use wireframe display with paraview).

* The force value for each line.

.. warning::
 The force chains feature is not implemented for contact occurring through periodic boundaries. 

The following video shows force chains for the `Rectangular Hopper example <../../examples/dem/rectangular-hopper/rectangular-hopper.html>`_.
