Post-processing
===============

Lethe-DEM has built-in post-processing capabilities. All post-processing results are written as VTU file, generated with the same ``output frequency`` as the particles' results (see the :doc:`../dem/simulation_control` section of this guide). The name of the generated files are the same the one chosen for the particles' results plus the suffix ``-postprocess_data``. The files include:

* The grid of the domain, with the distribution of the subdomains generated by the load balance (more information about load balancing is provided in the :doc:`../dem/model_parameters` section of this guide).

* The spatial average of the particle's velocity (in x, y, z and its norm) for each cell.

* The granular temperature for each cell.

.. important::
 The particles' average velocity and the granular temperature are cell based results calculated instantaneously at each outputting time-step. This means that they are only instantaneous spatial averages, i.e, DO NOT correspond to temporal averages measured between the outputs. For a higher resolution of the results in time, we recommend the use of a lower ``output frequency`` (:doc:`../dem/simulation_control`).

The post-processing subsection of the ``.prm`` file is according to the following example:

.. code-block:: text

 subsection post-processing
  # Enable output of grid, granular temperature, and particles' average velocity
  set Lagrangian post-processing = false
 end

.. note::
 By default, the post-processing is set to ``false``.

* The ``Lagrangian post-processing`` enables the built-in post-processing. The current outputs include the grid of the domain, the granular temperature, and the average velocity of particles (in x, y, z and its norm).
