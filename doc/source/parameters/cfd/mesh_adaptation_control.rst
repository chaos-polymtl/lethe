* Two ``type`` of mesh adaptation are available. The ``uniform`` mesh adaptation refines the mesh at every cell, whereas the ``kelly`` uses a `kelly error estimator <https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/classKellyErrorEstimator.html>`_ to decide which cell are refined, by estimating the error per cell for a given variable. 
* The variable for kelly estimation should be specified with ``set variable``, and can be:
	* velocity
	* pressure
	* phase (for multiphase flows)
	* temperature
* The frequency at which the mesh is refined is controlled with the ``frequency`` parameter. If ``set frequency = 1``, the mesh is refined at every iteration. 
	* For transient simulation, this means at every time-step. 
	* For steady-state simulation in which the steady-state problem is solved on successively refined meshes, the user should have ``set frequency = 1``, which is the default value.

* The minimal and maximal refinement level reachable for a cell are controlled respectively with the ``min refinement`` and ``max refinement`` parameters.
   * for ``deal.ii`` meshes, if the ``min refinement level`` is equal to the ``initial refinement`` (see `Mesh paramater <https://lethe-cfd.github.io/lethe/parameters/cfd/mesh.html>`_), no cell will be coarser than the initial mesh.
   * for ``gmsh`` imported meshes, if ``set min refinement level = 0``, no cell will be coarser than the initial mesh.

.. tip:: 
	For a ``gmsh`` mesh, a cell cannot be coarsened more than it's initial level. Consequently, adaptively refined simulations should start with a mesh as coarse as possible. 

.. tip:: 
	For a good compromise between speed and precision, ``max refinement level`` should be set to ``2`` or ``3`` more than the ``min refinement level``

* The fraction of cell that are refined and coarsened are controlled with the ``fraction refinement`` and ``fraction coarsening`` parameters. 

.. tip:: 
	For ``set type = kelly``, and ``set variable = velocity`` or ``pressure``, a good first start is achieve with ``set fraction refinement = 0.2`` and ``set fraction coarsening = 0.1``.

	For ``set type = kelly``, and ``set variable = phase``, use ``fraction type = fraction`` (explained below) and ``set fraction refinement = 0.8`` for a good tracking of the entire free surface (see `Multiphysics <file:///home/jeannej/Softwares/lethe/lethe/doc/build/html/parameters/cfd/multiphysics.html>`_).

* The fraction of refinement/coarsening can be interpreted in ``number`` or ``fraction``  depending on the parameter ``fraction type``. At first sight, this is a relatively difficult concept to understand that is inherited from deal.II. 
	* When ``fraction type = number``  the  `refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number <https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/namespaceGridRefinement.html#a48e5395381ed87155942a61a1edd134d>`_ strategy of deal.II is used. This function provides a strategy to mark cells for refinement and coarsening with the goal of providing predictable growth in the size of the mesh by refining  and coarsening a given fraction of all cells.  
	* When ``fraction type = fraction``,  the `refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction <https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/namespaceGridRefinement.html#ae90dc87c4db158b8d01f6d564ac614e5>`_ strategy is used. This function provides a strategy to mark cells for refinement and coarsening with the goal of controlling the reduction of the error estimate. Also known as the bulk criterion or DÃ¶rfler marking, this function computes the thresholds for refinement and coarsening such that the criteria of cells getting flagged for refinement make up for a certain fraction of the total error.


* The maximum number of elements in the entire domain can be controlled with the ``max number elements`` parameter.

.. warning::
	The ``max number elements`` parameter puts a hard limit on the number of cells in the domain, even if the ``fraction refinement`` is increased.
