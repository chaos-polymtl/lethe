==================
Simulation Control
==================

This subsection is the most important in a simulation and therefore, the most commonly modified in a parameter file. It controls the general parameters of the simulation, such as, the time integration method, end time of a simulation and output settings for paraview files. 

.. tip::
	A standard convention in Lethe is to keep this section at the top of the parameter file, since it is generally the most accessed one.

.. seealso::
	For further understanding about the numerical method used and advanced parameters, the interested reader is referred to the theory guide.

* ``method``: time-stepping method used. The available options are: 
	* ``steady``: steady-state simulation
	* ``steady_bdf``: steady-state simulation using adjoint time stepping with a bdf1 scheme
	* ``bdf1``: 1st order backward differentiation
	* ``bdf2``: 2nd order backward differentiation
	* ``bdf3``: 3rd order backward differentiation

-----------------------------------
Steady-state simulation parameters
-----------------------------------

* ``number mesh adapt``: number of mesh adaptations during the steady-state simulation.

* ``stop tolerance``: tolerance at which the adjoint time stepping steady state simulation (``method = steady_bdf``) stops. 


.. note::
	The adjoint time stepping will stop when the :math:`\mathcal{L}_2` norm of the initial residual is lower than ``stop tolerance`` at the start of a non-linear solution step.

----------------------
BDF scheme parameters
----------------------

* ``bdf startup method``: scheme used to start a high order bdf scheme (2nd order and above). The available options are: 
	* ``multiple step bdf``
	* ``initial solution``

* ``startup time scaling``: scaling factor used in the iterations necessary to startup the BDF schemes.

---------------------------------
Transient simulations parameters
---------------------------------

* ``time end``: value of the time to end the transient simulation.

* ``time step``: value of the time step.

* ``adapt``: controls if adaptive time-stepping is enabled. If set to ``true``, the time-step will evolve to ensure that the ``max cfl`` value is reached.

* ``max cfl``: maximum value of the :math:`\text{CFL}` condition that can be reached during the simulation. This parameter is only used when ``set adapt = true``.

* ``max time step``: maximum time step value that can be reached during the simulation. This parameter is only used when ``set adapt = true``. It is useful when the problem of interest has an additional time step constraint such as the capillary time step limit described in :doc:`../../examples/multiphysics/capillary-wave/capillary-wave`.

* ``adaptative time step scaling``: rate of increase of the time step value. The new time step value is fixed by ``adaptative time step scaling`` * ``previous value of the time step``.

* ``time step independent of end time``: this variable ensures that the time step of the simulation is always consistent at the end of the simulation. If one uses a time step that eventually leads exactly to the end time of the simulation this variable does not do anything. However, if adaptive time stepping is used or the end time is not exactly reached when using certain fixed time step, this flag ensures that the simulation does not change the last time step to reach the end time. For example, if your end time is 20, and you have a time step that leads to a last iteration until 20.1, all your results will be outputted until 20.1. If you wish to have exactly 20, you need to set this flag to ``false``. 

--------------------
Log file parameters
--------------------

* ``log frequency``: frequency at which information is written in terminal.

* ``log precision``: number of significant digits used when writting in terminal.

--------------------------------
Paraview output file parameters
--------------------------------

* ``output path``: directory for the output files.

* ``output name``: prefix for the Paraview output files (``.pvd`` / ``.vtu``)

.. important::
	Lethe saves the simulation results in the Paraview format: ``.vtu`` for one iteration, and ``.pvd`` files linking all iterations together. Use the open-source software `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_ to visualize them.

* ``output control``: control for the output of the simulation results. The available options are: 
	* ``iteration``: results will be outputted at constant iteration frequency. The time interval for this kind of output can also be specified.
	* ``time`` : results will be outputted based on time parameters (specific times or time frequency). The results can also be outputted for certain time interval.

* ``output frequency``: controls after which number of iterations the ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` results are written. This parameter is only used when ``set output control = iteration``.

.. tip::
	If ``set output frequency = 0``, no ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` file will be written.

	If the ``output frequency`` is set at a higher number than the total number of iterations in the simulation, the startup iteration will still be outputted.

* ``output time frequency``: controls the time frequency when the ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` results are written, e.g., if set to 1, paraview files will be outputted every second. This parameter is only used when ``set output control = time``.

* ``output times``: allows to specify specific times for the output of ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu``. This parameter is only used when ``set output control = time``. As an example, one can output files only at 5 seconds, by setting ``set output times = 5`` or at multiple specific times separating the values with commas: ``set output times = 5, 14``.

* ``output time interval``: Only writes the ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` files when the simulation time is within the closed interval defined by the ``output time interval``. Default values are 0s and 1.7e308s. Used for both ``iteration`` and ``time`` output control.

.. warning::
	Since it is possible that the times specified in the interval or in specific output times do not correspond to the time of specific iterations, Lethe will always write the paraview files before and after the time specified. 

* ``group files``: number of ``.vtu`` files generated in a parallel simulation

.. tip::
	This parameter allows to reduce the number of files generated when the simulation is run with a large number of processors. ``set group files = 1`` ensures that a single ``.vtu`` file will be generated. In this case, the file is written using MPI IO functionalities.

	The value for this parameter should always be a compromise between keeping a low number of files but preventing excessive MPI communications. We have found that the default value of 1 does not have a significant impact on performance on Compute Canada clusters.

	.. warning::
		However, as soon as the size of the output ``.vtu`` file reaches 1 Gb, it is preferable to start splitting them into multiple smaller files as this may lead to corrupted files on some file systems.

* ``output boundaries``: controls if the boundaries of the domain are written to a file. This will write additional ``.vtu`` files made of the contour of the domain. 

.. tip::
	This is particularly useful for the visualisation of 3D flows with obstacles or objects.

* ``subdivision``: sub-division of the mesh cells to enable visualisation of high-order elements with Paraview. 

.. tip::
	Generally, we advise to use a subdivision level of :math:`(n)` for interpolation order of :math:`n`. For example, a Q2-Q1 interpolation could be visualized with ``set subdivision = 2``.
