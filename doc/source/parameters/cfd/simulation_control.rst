Simulation Control
==================

This subsection contains the general information of the simulation, including the time integration method and the general output names. It is the most commonly modified section for a simulation. 

.. tip::
	A standard convention in Lethe is to keep this section at the top of the parameter file, since it is generally the most accessed one.

.. seealso::
	For further understanding about the numerical method used and advanced parameters, the interested reader is referred to the Theory Documentation.

* ``method``: time-stepping method used. The available options are: 
	* ``steady``: steady-state simulation
	* ``steady_bdf``: steady-state simulation using adjoint time stepping with a bdf1 scheme
	* ``bdf1``: 1st order backward differentiation
	* ``bdf2``: 2nd order backward differentiation
	* ``bdf3``: 3rd order backward differentiation
	* ``sdirk2``: 2nd order singly diagonally implicit Runge Kutta
	* ``sdirk3``: 3rd order singly diagonally implicit Runge Kutta

* ``number mesh adapt``: number of mesh adaptations during the steady-sate simulation

* ``stop tolerance``: tolerance at which the adjoint time stepping steady state simulation (``method = steady_bdf``) stops. 

.. note::
	The adjoint time stepping will stop when the :math:`\mathcal{L}_2` norm of the initial residual is lower than ``stop tolerance`` at the start of a non-linear solution step.

* ``bdf startup method``: scheme used to start a high order bdf scheme (2nd order and above). The available options are: 
	* ``multiple step bdf``
	* ``sdirk step``
	* ``initial solution``

* ``startup time scaling``: scaling factor used in the iterations necessary to startup the BDF schemes

* ``time end``: value of the time to end the transient simulation

* ``time step``: value of the time step

* ``adapt``: controls if adaptive time-stepping is enabled. If set to ``true``, the time-step will evolve to ensure that the ``max cfl`` value is reached.

* ``max cfl``: maximal value of the :math:`\text{CFL}` condition that can be reached during the simulation. This parameter is only used when ``set adapt = true``.

* ``adaptative time step scaling``: rate of increase of the time step value. The new time step value is fixed by ``adaptative time step scaling`` * ``previous value of the time step``

* ``log frequency``: frequency at which information is written in terminal

* ``log precision``: number of significant digits used when writting in terminal

* ``output path``: directory for the output files

.. warning::
	Lethe will not automatically create the directory specified in ``output path``, it must exists prior to launching the simulation.

* ``output name``: prefix for the Paraview output files (``.pvd`` / ``.vtu``)

.. important::
	Lethe saves the simulation results in the Paraview format: ``.vtu`` for one iteration, and ``.pvd`` files linking all iterations together. Use the open-source Software `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_ to visualize them.

* ``output control``: control for the output of the simulation results. The available options are: 
	* ``iteration``: results will be outputted at constant iteration frequency
	* ``time`` : results will be outputted at constant time

* ``output frequency``: controls after which number of iterations the ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` results are written. This parameter is only used when ``set output control = iteration``.

.. tip::
	If ``set output frequency = 0``, no ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` file will be written.

	If the ``output frequency`` is set at a higher number than the total number of iterations in the simulation, the startup iteration will still be outputted.


* ``output time``: controls the time when the ``.pvd`` / ``.vtu`` results are written. This parameter is only used when ``set output control = time``.

* ``group files``: number of ``.vtu`` files generated in a parallel simulation

.. tip::
	This parameter allows to reduce the number of files generated when the simulation is run with a large number of processors. ``set group files = 1`` ensures that a single ``.vtu`` file will be generated. In this case, the file is written using MPI IO functionalities.

	The value for this parameter should always be a compromise between keeping a low number of files but preventing excessive MPI communications. We have found that the default value of 1 does not have a significant impact on performance on Compute Canada clusters.

	.. warning::
		However, as soon as the size of the output ``.vtu`` file reaches 1 Gb, it is preferable to start splitting them into multiple smaller files as this may lead to corrupted files on some file systems.

* ``output boundaries``: controls if the boundaries of the domain are written to a file. This will write additional ``.vtu`` files made of the contour of the domain. 

.. tip::
	This is particularly useful for the visualisation of 3D flows with obstacles or objects.

* ``subdivision``: sub-division of the mesh cells to enable visualisation of high-order elements with Paraview. 

.. tip::
	Generally, we advise to use a subdivision level of :math:`(n)` for interpolation order of :math:`n`. For example, a Q2-Q1 interpolation could be visualized with ``set subdivision = 2``.
