.. note:: 
    Lethe supports both single phase and two phase (through VOF) simulations. The same subsection is used to manage both types of simulation using the fluid subsections.

  end
 
* The ``rheological model`` parameter sets the choice of rheological model. The choices are between ``newtonian``, ``power-law``, ``carreau`` and ``phase_change``. For more details on the rheological model, see  `Rheological models`_ .

* The ``kinematic viscosity`` parameter is the kinematic viscosity of the newtonain fluid in units of :math:`\text{Length}^{2} \cdot \text{Time}^{-1}`. In SI this is :math:`\text{m}^{2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}`. This viscosity is only used when ``rheological model = newtonian``.

* The ``density model`` specifies the model used to calculate the density. At the moment, only a constant density is supported.

* The ``density`` parameter is the constant density of the fluid in units of :math:`\text{Mass} \cdot \text{Length}^{-3}`

* The ``specific heat model`` specifies the model used to calculate the specific heat. At the moment, only a constant specific heat is supported.

* The ``specific heat`` parameter is the constant specific heat of the fluid in units of :math:`\text{Energy} \cdot \text{Temperature}^{-1} \cdot \text{Mass}^{-1}` .

* The ``thermal conductivity model`` specifies the model used to calculate the thermal conductivity. At the moment, ``constant`` and ``linear`` thermal conductivity are available. For more details on the thermal conductivity models, see `Thermal conductivity models`_.

* The ``thermal conductivity`` parameter is the thermal conductivity coefficient of the fluid with units of :math:`\text{Power} \cdot \text{Temperature}^{-1} \cdot \text{Length}^{-1}`.

* The ``thermal expansion model`` specifies the model used to calculate the thermal expansion coefficient. At the moment, only a constant thermal expansion is supported.

* The ``thermal expansion`` parameter is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid with dimension of :math:`\text{Temperature}^{-1}`. Thermal expansion coefficient is used to define the buoyancy-driven flow (natural convection) using the Boussinesq approximation. Using the Boussinesq approximation, the following source term is added to the Navier-Stokes equation.

.. math::

  {\bf{F_{B}}} = -\beta {\bf{g}} (T-T_0) 

where :math:`F_B` denotes the buoyant force source term, :math:`\beta` is the thermal expansion coefficient, :math:`T` is temperature, and :math:`T_0` is the base temperature.

* The ``tracer diffusivity model`` specifies the model used to calculate the tracer diffusivity. At the moment, only a constant tracer diffusivity is supported.

* The ``tracer diffusivity`` parameter is the diffusivity coefficient of the tracer in units of :math:`\text{Length}^{2} \cdot \text{Time}^{-1}` . In SI this is :math:`\text{m}^{2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}` .

.. note:: 
  The default values for all physical properties models in Lethe is ``constant``. Consequently, it is not necessary (and not recommended) to specify the physical property model unless this model is not constant. This generates parameter files that are easier to read.

.. _two phase simulations:

Two phase simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note:: 
  Two phase simulations require that ``set VOF = true`` in the :doc:`multiphysics` subsection. By convention, air is usually the ``fluid 0`` and the other fluid of interest is the ``fluid 1``.

For two phases, the properties are defined for each fluid. Default values are:

.. code-block:: text

  subsection physical properties
  set number of fluids		= 2
      subsection fluid 0
         set density 		= 1
         set kinematic viscosity 	= 1
         set specific heat 	= 1
         set thermal conductivity = 1
         set tracer diffusivity   = 0
      end
      subsection fluid 1
         set density 		= 1
         set kinematic viscosity 	= 1
         set specific heat 	= 1
         set thermal conductivity = 1
         set tracer diffusivity   = 0
      end
  end

* ``number of fluids = 2`` is required for a free surface simulation, otherwise an error will be thrown in the terminal.
* ``subsection fluid 0`` indicates the properties of fluid where the phase indicator = 0 (Volume of Fluid method), as defined when initializing the free surface (see the :doc:`initial_conditions` subsection), and correspondingly ``fluid 1`` is located where the phase indicator = 1.

.. warning:: 
  Lethe now supports the use of physical properties models that are different for both phases. For example, the liquid could have a carreau rheological model and the air could have a newtonian rheological model. However, this feature has not been fully tested and could lead to unpredictable results. Use with caution.


.. _rheological_models:

Rheological models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two families of rheological models are supported in Lethe. The first one are generalized non Newtonian rheologies (for shear thinning and shear thickening flows). In these models, the viscosity depends on the shear rate. The second family of rheological models possess a viscosity that is independent of the shear rate, but that may depend on other fields such as the temperature.

The ``rheological model`` parameter sets which rheological model you are using. The default ``rheological model`` is ``newtonian``, which uses a constant ``kinematic viscosity``.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection physical properties
      set number of fluids		= 1
      subsection fluid 0
        set rheological model   = newtonian
        set kinematic viscosity = 1.0
      end
    end

The rheological model available options are:
    * ``newtonian``
    * ``power-law`` 
    * ``carreau``
    * ``phase_change``

Power-law model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The power-law model is the simplest rheological model, using only 2 parameters 

.. math::

  \eta(\dot{\gamma}) = K \dot{\gamma}^{n-1}


where :math:`\eta` is the **kinematic viscosity** and :math:`\dot{\gamma}` is the local shear rate magnitude.

.. image:: images/physical_properties_powerlaw.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

When using the power-law model, the default values are:

.. code-block:: text

  subsection physical properties
    set number of fluids		  = 1
    subsection fluid 0
      set rheological model   = power-law
      subsection non newtonian
        subsection power-law
          set K               = 1.0
          set n               = 0.5
          set shear rate min  = 1e-3
        end
      end
    end
  end

* The ``K`` parameter is a fluid consistency index. It represents the fluid viscosity for a local shear rate of :math:`1.0`.

* The ``n`` parameter is the flow behavior index. It sets the slope in the log-log :math:`\eta = f(\dot{\gamma})` graph.

* The ``shear rate min`` parameter yields the magnitude of the shear rate tensor for which the viscosity is calculated. Since the model uses a power operation, a null shear rate magnitude leads to an invalid viscosity. To ensure numerical stability, the shear rate cannot go below this threshold when the viscosity  calculated.

Carreau model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Carreau model is in reality the five parameter Carreau model:

.. math::

  \eta(\dot{\gamma}) =\eta_{\infty} + (\eta_0 - \eta_{\infty}) \left[ 1 + (\dot{\gamma}\lambda)^a\right]^{\frac{n-1}{a}}
 
where :math:`\eta` is the **kinematic viscosity** and :math:`\dot{\gamma}` is the shear rate.

.. image:: images/physical_properties_carreau.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

The parameters for the Carreau model are defined by the ``carreau`` subsection. The default values are:

.. code-block:: text

  subsection physical properties
    set number of fluids		  = 1
    subsection fluid 0
      set rheological model   = carreau
      subsection non newtonian
        subsection carreau
          set viscosity_0	   = 1.0
          set viscosity_inf   = 1.0
          set a               = 2.0
          set lambda          = 1.0
          set n               = 0.5
        end
      end
    end
  end

* The ``viscosity_0`` parameter represents the viscosity when the shear rate on the fluid tends to 0.

* The ``viscosity_inf`` parameter represents the viscosity when the shear rate on the fluid becomes large.

* The ``a`` is the Carreau parameter, generally set to 2.

* The ``lambda`` is the relaxation time associated to the fluid.

* The ``n`` is a power parameter. It sets the slope in the log-log :math:`\eta = f(\dot{\gamma})` graph just like in the power-law model.

.. note::
    The Carreau model is only suitable for Newtonian and shear-thinning flows.

Phase-change model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

The phase change model is a simple rheological model in which the viscosity depends on the temperature. This model is used to model melting and freezing of components. The kinematic viscosity :math:`\nu` is given by :

.. math::

  \nu =   c^{*}_p  = \begin{cases} \nu_s \; \text{if} \; T<T_{s} \\
              \frac{T-T_s}{T_l-T_s} \nu_l + (1-\frac{T-T_s}{T_l-T_s}) \nu_s \; \text{if} \; T_{l}>T>T_{s}\\
              \nu_l \; \text{if} \; T>T_{l}
              \end{cases}

where :math:`T_l` and :math:`T_s` are the liquidus and solidus temperature. The underlying hypothesis of this model is that the melting and the solidification occurs over a phase change interval. Melting will occur between :math:`T_s` and :math:`T_l` and solidification will occur between :math:`T_l` and :math:`T_s`.

This model is parameterized using the ``phase change`` subsection

.. code-block:: text

  subsection phase change
    # Temperature of the liquidus
    set liquidus temperature = 1
  
    # Temperature of the solidus
    set solidus temperature  = 0

    # Specific heat of the liquid phase
    set viscosity liquid = 1
  
    # viscosity of the solid phase
    set viscosity solid  = 1
  end


* The ``liquidus temperature`` is :math:`T_l`

* The ``solidus temperature`` is :math:`T_s`

* The ``specific heat liquid`` is :math:`\nu_{l}`

* The ``specific heat solid`` is :math:`\nu_{s}`

.. note::
  The phase change subsection is used to parametrize *both* ``rheological model = phase_change`` *and* ``specific heat model = phase_change``. This prevents parameter duplication.


.. _thermal_conductivity_models:

Thermal conductivity models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constant, linear and phase_change thermal conductivities are supported in Lethe. Constant thermal conductivity assumes a constant value of the thermal conductivity. Linear thermal conductivity assumes that that the thermal conductivity :math:`k` varies linearly with the temperature, taking the following form:

.. math::
  k = k_{A,0}+ k_{A,1} T 

where :math:`k_{A,0}` and :math:`k_{A,1}` are constants and :math:`T` is the temperature. This enables a linear variation of the thermal conductivity as a function of the temperature.

In the ``phase_change`` thermal conductivity model, two different values (``thermal conductivity liquid``, and ``thermal conductivity solid``) are required for calculating the thermal conductivities of the liquid and solid phases, respectively. For the liquid phase (T>T_liquidus), the ``thermal conductivity liquid`` is applied, while for the solid phase (T<T_solidus), the model uses the ``thermal conductivity solid``. In the mushy zone between T_solidus and T_liquidus, the thermal conductivity is equal to:

.. math::

  k = \alpha_l k_l + (1 - \alpha_l) k_s


where :math:`k_l`, :math:`k_s` and  :math:`alpha_l` denote thermal conductivities of the liquid and solid phases and the liquid fraction.

Specific heat models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lethe supports two types of specific heat models. Setting ``specific heat=constant`` sets a constant specific heat. Lethe also supports a ``phase_change`` specific heat model. This model can simulate the melting and solidification of a material. The model follows the work of Blais & Ilinca `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2018.03.037>`_. This approach defines the specific heat :math:`C_p` as:

.. math::

  C_p = \frac{H(T)-H(T_0)}{T-T_0}


where :math:`T` is the temperature, :math:`T_0` is the temperature at the previous time and :math:`H(T)` is the enthalpy, as a function of the temperature, to be:

.. math::
  H(T) = H_0 + \int_{T_0}^{T} c^{*}_p (T^*) dT


where :math:`H_0` is a reference enthalpy, taken to be 0, and :math:`c^{*}_p` is:

.. math::
  c^{*}_p  = \begin{cases} C_{p,s}\\
              \frac{C_{p,s}+C_{p,l}}{2}+\frac{h_l}{T_l-T_s}\\
              C_{p,l}
              \end{cases}

where :math:`C_{p,s}` and :math:`C_{p,l}` are the solid and liquid specific heat, respectively. :math:`h_l` is the latent enthalpy (enthalpy related to the phase change), :math:`T_l` and :math:`T_s` are the liquidus and solidus temperature. The underlying hypothesis of this model is that the melting and the solidification occurs over a phase change interval. Melting will occur between :math:`T_s` and :math:`T_l` and solidification will occur between :math:`T_l` and :math:`T_s`.

This model is parameterized using the following section:

.. code-block:: text

  subsection phase change
    # Enthalpy of the phase change
    set latent enthalpy      = 1
  
    # Temperature of the liquidus
    set liquidus temperature = 1
  
    # Temperature of the solidus
    set solidus temperature  = 0
  
    # Specific heat of the liquid phase
    set specific heat liquid = 1
  
    # Specific heat of the solid phase
    set specific heat solid  = 1
  end

* The ``latent enthalpy`` is the latent enthalpy of the phase change: :math:`h_l`

* The ``liquidus temperature`` is :math:`T_l`

* The ``solidus temperature`` is :math:`T_s`

* The ``specific heat liquid`` is :math:`C_{p,l}`

* The ``specific heat solid`` is :math:`C_{p,s}`
