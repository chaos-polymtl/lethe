Stabilization
=============

To solve the Navier-Stokes equations (and other), Lethe uses stabilization techniques to formulate a Petrov-Galerkin strategy in which the test function is not strictly equal to the interpolation. The stabilization provided by Lethe are relatively robust and do not require any manual tinkering. However, stabilization of FEM schemes remain an active area a research, notably when it comes to variational multi-scales (VMS) methods. This is a field in which we are doing active research. As such, Lethe possesses some advanced parameters to control the stabilization techniques used to solve the Navier-Stokes. These are *advanced* parameters and, in general, the defaults value should be used.

  subsection stabilization
    set use default stabilization = true

    set stabilization             = pspg_supg     # <pspg_supg|gls|grad_div>.

    # Pressure scaling factor
    set pressure scaling factor   = 1
  end
  

The ``use default stabilization`` indicates that the solver should use the default stabilization strategy, which is generally the most adequate strategy. To use an alternative strategy, this parameter must be set to false and the strategy to be used must be manually specified using the ``stabilization`` parameter.

There are three choices of stabilization strategy:

* ``stabilization=pspg-supg`` assembles a PSPG/SUPG stabilization for the Navier-Stokes equations. This stabilization should only be used with the monolithic GLS solver.

* ``stabilization=gls`` assembles a full GLS stabilization for the Navier-Stokes equations. This stabilization is similar to the ``pspg-supg``, but adds the term :math:`\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}` to the test function. This stabilization should only be used with the monolithic GLS solver.

* ``stabilization=grad_div`` assembles a grad-div penalization term in the momentum equation to ensure mass conservation. This is not a stabilization method per-say and should not be used with elements that are not LBB stable. This stabilization should only be used with the grad-div Navier-Stokes solver (``gd_navier_stokes_2d`` and ``gd_navier_stokes_3d``)

The ``pressure scaling factor`` parameter is used as a multiplier for the pressure in the momentum equation; the inverse of the factor is applied to the pressure after solving. It helps the convergence of the linear solver  by decreasing the condition number for cases where pressure and velocity have very different scales.
