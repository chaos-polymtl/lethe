* The ``method`` parameter enables to choose an iterative solver for the linear system of equations. Lethe currently supports these core solution strategies:
	* ``gmres`` (default parameter value), a GMRES iterative solver with ILU preconditioning.
	* ``amg``, a GMRES iterative solver with AMG preconditioning and an ILU coarsener and smoother.
	* ``bicgstab``, a BICGSTAB iterative solver with ILU preconditioning.
	* ``direct``, a direct solver using `TrilinosWrappers::SolverDirect <https://www.dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/classTrilinosWrappers_1_1SolverDirect.html>`_.

	.. hint::
		Which solver is the most efficient for a given problem?
		
		* For steady-state problems (2D and 3D):
			* coarse meshes: ``gmres``/``bicgstab`` solver with ILU preconditioning.
			* fine meshes (from :math:`\approx 1` M cells): ``amg`` solver.
		* For transient problems, this is much more problem dependent, but generally:
			* relatively low :math:`\text{CFL}` condition: ``gmres`` solver with a low fill level, for instance ``set ilu preconditioner fill = 0``. This applies even the mesh is very large (:math:`>10` M cells), because the transient version of the system of equation is much easier to solve.
			* large :math:`\text{CFL}` condition (:math:`\text{CFL}>10`) and/or very large mesh: ``amg`` solver may become preferable.

	.. caution:: 
		Be aware that the setup of the ``amg`` preconditioner is very expensive and does not scale linearly with the size of the matrix. As such, it is generally preferable to minimize the number of assembly of such preconditioner. This can be achieved by using the ``inexact newton`` (see :doc:`non-linear_solver_control`).
		
		The use of ``direct`` solver should be avoided for 3D problems.

.. warning::
    Currently, the ``gls_sharp_navier_stokes_2d`` and ``gls_sharp_navier_stokes_2d`` solvers make it almost impossible to reach convergence with the ``amg`` linear solver. It is recommended to use ``gmres`` instead, even for fine meshes.


* The ``verbosity`` option enables the display of the residual at each non-linear iteration, to monitor the progress of the linear iterations.

.. admonition:: Example of a ``set verbosity = verbose`` output:

	.. code-block:: text

		-Tolerance of iterative solver is : 0.0429541
		-Iterative solver took : 11 steps 
		-Tolerance of iterative solver is : 3.62082e-05
		-Iterative solver took : 16 steps 
		-Tolerance of iterative solver is : 1.05775e-08
		-Iterative solver took : 17 steps 
		-Tolerance of iterative solver is : 1.00205e-12
		-Iterative solver took : 16 steps 
		-Tolerance of iterative solver is : 1e-13
		-Iterative solver took : 5 steps 
		-Tolerance of iterative solver is : 1e-13
		-Iterative solver took : 0 steps 


* The ``minimum residual`` for the linear solver.

* The ``relative residual`` for the linear solver.

.. tip::
	A good rule of thumb is to set the linear solver ``minimum residual`` at least :math:`10` times (preferably :math:`100` times) smaller than the :doc:`non-linear_solver_control`, ``tolerance`` parameter, and keep the relative residual reasonable, for instance ``set relative residual = 1e-3``. To lower the computational cost for more complex simulations, it can be lowered to ``set relative residual = 1e-4``.

* The ``max iters`` puts a hard stop on the number of solver iterations (number of steps printed when ``set verbosity = verbose``).

.. tip::
	If ``max iters`` is reached, the code will throw this type of message: 
	
	.. code-block:: text
	
		GMRES solver failed! Trying with a higher preconditioner fill level.

	meaning that the code increases the preconditioner fill (see definition below) in order to converge within the number of solver iterations. If you encounter this, consider increasing the ``max iters`` or adjusting other parameters, for example increasing ``max krylov vectors``.

* ``force linear solver continuation`` enables, when set to ``true``, to force the linear solver to continue, even if the ``minimum residual`` is not reached. Only available for ``GMRES`` solver within the ``gls_navier_stokes`` application.

.. warning::
	With this mode on, errors on the linear solver convergence are not thrown. Forcing the solver to continue can be useful for debugging purposes if a given iteration is hard to pass, but use with caution!

* ``max krylov vectors`` sets the maximum number of krylov vectors for ``GMRES`` and ``AMG`` solvers.

.. tip::
	Consider using ``set max krylov vectors = 200`` for complex simulations with convergence issues. 

* ``ilu preconditioner fill``, ``ilu preconditioner absolute tolerance`` and ``ilu preconditioner relative tolerance`` control the ILU preconditioner for ``method`` using ILU preconditioner (``gmres`` and ``bicgstab``). Conversely, ``amg preconditioner ilu fill``, ``amg preconditioner ilu absolute tolerance`` and ``amg preconditioner ilu relative tolerance`` control the ILU coarsener and smoother for the AMG preconditioner.
 
.. tip::
	The default values for these parameters are good starting values. 

	For each iteration of the linear solver (at the beginning of which the tolerance of the iterative solver is computed, as printed if ``set verbosity = verbose``), the chosen solver starts by using the ``preconditioner fill`` given in the parameter file. If for any reason the linear solver would have crashed, it will restart with a fill level increased by 1. This restart process will happen up to a maximum of 3 times, after which it will let the solver crash. 

	Hence, for complex simulations, if you get at almost every linear iteration the message:

	.. code-block:: text
	
		GMRES solver failed! Trying with a higher preconditioner fill level. New fill = ...

	and it does not disappear when increasing ``max iters``, increasing the ``ilu preconditioner fill`` in the ``.prm`` file will make the computation slightly faster.

* ``amg aggregation threshold``, ``amg n cycles``, ``amg w cycles`` (if this is set to ``true``, W cycling is used, if ``false``, V cycling is used), ``amg smoother sweeps``, and ``amg smoother overlap`` are parameters used for the AMG ``method`` only.
