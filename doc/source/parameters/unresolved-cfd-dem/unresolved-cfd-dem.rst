Unresolved CFD-DEM
***********************************************
The CFD-DEM solver templates are available in both 2D (``cfd_dem_coupling_2d``) and 3D (``cfd_dem>_coupling_3d``). The following parameter subsections are defined similarly to the CFD parameter template: "Simulation Control", "FEM", "Physical Properties" which represent the properties of the fluid, :doc:`../cfd/mesh/`, :doc:`../cfd/initial_conditions`, and :doc:`../cfd/boundary_conditions_cfd`. The following parameter subsections are defined similarly to the DEM parameter template: :doc:`../dem/model_parameters` and :doc:`../dem/lagrangian_physical_properties` which represents the physical properties of the solid phase (particles). Two new subsections are introduced for the Volume Averaged Navier Stokes (VANS) solver as well as for the coupled unresolved CFD-DEM simulations. These are :doc:`void-fraction` and :doc:`cfd-dem` subsections. Parameters that are only applicable to the CFD-DEM solver are mentioned in their definitions.
