Lethe (pronounced /ˈliːθiː/) is an open-source computational fluid dynamics
(CFD), discrete element method (DEM) and coupled CFD-DEM
software which uses high-order continuous Galerkin formulations to
simulate single and multiphase flows.
Lethe contains a family of solvers that are based on
[deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/), a finite element library.
Through deal.II, Lethe uses [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) for
its sparse linear algebra routines and [p4est](https://www.p4est.org/)
for its distributed adaptative quadtrees and octrees.

Lethe is named after the river of forgetfulness, which, according to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe),

> is one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld\[,\] the other four
> \[being\] Acheron (the river of sorrow), Cocytus (the river of
> lamentation), Phlegethon (the river of fire) and Styx (the river that
> separates Earth and the Underworld).
> …
> The shades of the dead were required to drink the waters of the Lethe
> in order to forget their earthly life.

Lethe is described [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100579).
It originally began as a weekend project, but slowly grew into a CFD, DEM and CFD-DEM
software used in actual research. Lethe is under active development. 


Note: Lethe would not exist without the dedicated work of the deal.II
authors.
The authors of Lethe would like to emphasize that without deal.II,
dedicated solvers like Lethe could not exist.
