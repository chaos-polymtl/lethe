CONTENT OF THIS EXAMPLE

TL;DR
Generate a geometry with SALOME, mesh it and then add the boundary IDs with GMSH, then use LETHE with simplices on to simulate a flow in a complex geometry.

1. Generating a geometry from SALOME 9.7.0
	1. Adding geometric objects
	2. Using boolean operations
	3. Dumping/loading .py file to edit settings
	4. Generating a .mesh with Mesh module from GMF export
2. Adding the boundary IDs from GMSH
	1. Loading the .mesh file
	2. Selecting the proper surfaces for inlet/outlet
	3. "Defaulting" the remaining surfaces to wall boundary
	4. Generating 3D mesh and exporting to .msh
3. Building the .prm file
	1. Adding "simplex = true" to the file
	2. For the boundary conditions, there is only one "no flux/default" condition, so we have to keep only one for this purpose (in case of tracer for example, use 3: Dirichlet 1, Dirichlet 0, Default no flux everywhere else)
