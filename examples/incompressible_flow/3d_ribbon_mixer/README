Ribbon mixer
This examples require that deal.II be compiled with the OpenCASCADE library
------
This example can be solved using the gls_navier_stokes_3d solver or, if the velocity is put to second order, the GD solver.
This example uses CAD-aware dynamic mesh refinement to simulate the flow generated by an helical ribbon in a Lagrangian
frame of reference
