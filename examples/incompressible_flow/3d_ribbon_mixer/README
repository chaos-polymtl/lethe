Ribbon mixer with simplex meshes

------
This example can be solved using the gls_navier_stokes_3d solver or, if the velocity is put to second order, the GD solver.
This example solvers the 3D flow in an helical-ribbon industrial mixer using a simplex mesh generated by GMSH.
The simulation is carried out in a rotating frame of reference so that the impeller can remain static.
