# Get neighbors of points
def get_nearest_neighbors(self, return_id = True, n_neighbors = 15):
    """
    Get indices, distances, and "ID" (if requested) of nearest neighbors of
    each point in self.df.

    Parameters:
    :param return_id = False         -> Decide whether ID is returned or not. If
    True, but self.df does not have "ID", attribute neighbors_id is not
    assigned.

    :param n_neighbors = 15         -> Number of neighbors to search for.

    This method assigns the following attributes to the object:

    self.df[$TIME-STEP].neighbors       -> Returns a lists with
    indices of neighbors per point in dataset.

    self.df[$TIME-STEP].neighbors_dist  -> Returns a list with distances
    between neighbor points per point in dataset.

    self.df[$TIME-STEP].neighbors_id    -> Returns a list with "ID"
    of neighbor points per point in dataset.

    !!!IMPORTANT!!!

    This method uses KDTree to find neighbors.

    If library sklearn is missing, the method will not work.
    To install sklearn, run the following line in your terminal:
    $ pip install scikit-learn
    or
    $ pip3 install scikit-learn
    At the moment of the implementation, sklearn version was: 1.2.1
