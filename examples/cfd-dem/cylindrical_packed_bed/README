3D flow in a packed bed

The packing_in_cylinder.prm parameter file is run with the application dem_3d and it simulates the non-uniform packing of particles in a cylinder. This will become the packed bed through which we will simulate a flow of gas.
The flow_in_bed.prm parameter file is run with the application gls_vans_3d and it simulates the flow of the gas through the bed.
