To use NOMAD with the rpt_3d application you need to :
- Modify the paths in script "rpt_nomad_lethe.py"
- Modify the initial guess of parameters and number of black box evaluations 
  for NOMAD in "param_nomad.txt"
- Run NOMAD with its parameter file with => /path/to/NOMAD/ param_nomad.txt

How it works :
- NOMAD will execute the Python script which in provided by the 
  "param_nomad.txt" file.
- The Python script "rpt_nomad_lethe.py" proceeds the values of parameters to 
  tune gave by NOMAD, modifies the parameter file for Lethe and runs the rpt_3d 
  application.
- rpt_3d of Lethe executes the Monte Carlo ray model and calculates a cost 
  function which is got by NOMAD
- NOMAD executes its MADS algorithm and generates new set of parameters until a 
  criteria

Note :
Two files are not used in the example execution but are still provided in the 
current directory. "noisy_positions.particle" keeps track of the positions used 
to generate noisy_counts.experimental and "real_counts.experimental" are results
 of articifial data with no noise with 10 000 000 MC iterations.
