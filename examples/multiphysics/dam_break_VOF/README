dam break (Martin and Moyce)

This example is solved using the gls_navier_stokes_2d solver. It demonstrates a dam break simulation using VOF with interface sharpening. Experimental and simulation results can be found in https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1952.0006 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045793019300428
