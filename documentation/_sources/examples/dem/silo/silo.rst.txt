Silo
==================================

This example simulates the filling and discharge of particles in a wedge-shaped silo. We set up this simulation according to the experiments of Golshan *et al.* [#golshan2020]_. It is recommended to visit the `DEM parameters <../../../parameters/dem/dem.html>`_ for more detailed information on the concepts and physical meanings of the parameters.

Description of the Case
-----------------------

This simulation consists of two stages: filling (0-4 s) and discharge (4-30 s) of particles. During the filling stage, we use a floating wall to keep the inserted particles in the hopper region of the silo. When all the particles are inserted and packed in the hopper, we remove the floating wall and the particles leave the hopper.

Mesh
~~~~~

In this example, we use a mesh generated using `Gmsh <https://gmsh.info/>`_. We refine this mesh once by setting ``initial refinement = 1`` to ensure that the cells are sufficiently small to enable efficient contact detection. The mesh generated by Gmsh contains diamond cells, which are cells that only share a line with the boundary and not a complete face. ``check diamond cells = true`` enables searching for diamond-shaped boundary cells. Such cells can appear in unstructured grids, but they are detrimental to the stability of DEM simulations. Enabling this option adds these cells to the particle-wall contact search cells and is necessary to ensure stable collisions with the wall in the vicinity of diamond cells.

      set initial refinement  = 1
    end


Insertion Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An insertion box is defined inside and on the top of the silo.

      set insertion method                               = volume

      set insertion box points coordinates               = -0.37, -0.042, 0.9 : 0.37, 0.007, 1.09
      set insertion distance threshold                   = 1.5
      set insertion maximum offset                       = 0.1
      set insertion prn seed                             = 19
    end


Lagrangian Physical Properties

      set g                        = 0.0, 0.0, -9.81

Model Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    subsection model parameters
      subsection contact detection
        set contact detection method                = dynamic
        set dynamic contact search size coefficient = 0.9
        set neighborhood threshold                  = 1.3
      end
      subsection load balancing
        set load balance method                     = frequent
        set frequency                               = 10000
      end
      set particle particle contact force method    = hertz_mindlin_limit_overlap
      set particle wall contact force method        = nonlinear
      set integration method                        = velocity_verlet
    end


Simulation Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    subsection simulation control
      set time step        = 2e-5
      set time end         = 30
      set log frequency    = 1000
      set output frequency = 1000
    end


Restart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this subsection, we specify the checkpointing parameters. Checkpoints are very useful in long simulations. If the simulation breaks, we can continue the simulation from the last written checkpoint. First, we enable checkpointing by setting the ``checkpoint`` parameter to true. Then, we specify the checkpointing ``frequency``.

.. code-block:: text

    subsection restart
      set checkpoint = true
      set frequency  = 100000
    end


Floating Walls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The floating wall is a temporary flat wall (its start and end times are defined) and it is generally used for holding the particles during the filling of particles within the simulation domain.

In this subsection, the information on the floating walls is defined. First of all, the total ``number of floating walls`` is specified. Then for each floating wall, we specify its ``normal vector``, a ``point on the wall``, ``start time`` and ``end time``.

In this simulation, we need a floating wall in the filling stage (0-4 s). Hence, we set ``start time`` and ``end time`` equal to 0 and 4, respectively. The wall should be in the `xy` plane and be located at the bottom of the silo. We use this information to select the point on the stopper (0, 0, 0) and its normal vector (0, 0, 1).

.. code-block:: text

    subsection floating walls
      set number of floating walls = 1
      subsection wall 0
        subsection point on wall
          set x = 0
          set y = 0
          set z = 0
        end
        subsection normal vector
          set nx = 0
          set ny = 0
          set nz = 1
        end
        set start time = 0
        set end time   = 4
      end
    end

Running the Simulation
----------------------
This simulation can be launched in parallel (e.g. using 8 processes) by running:

.. code-block:: text
  :class: copy-button

  mpirun -np 8 lethe-particles silo-Golshan.prm

.. warning::
  This example takes approximately 14 hours on 8 cores. This high computational time is due to the long simulation time (30 s of real-time).
